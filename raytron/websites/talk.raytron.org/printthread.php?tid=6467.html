Hi,so recently i have been thinking about dual booting Mac OSX Snow Leopard With Windows 7.Hoping To do web browsing and text editing on the Mac because of viruses and malware.On the Windows doing video editing,photo editing and light gaming.Here are my computer specs: <br />
<br />
 Intel e5700 3.00 GHz<br />
<br />
 4 GB of ram<br />
<br />
 250 GB HDD<br />

seriously, if you wanna run the Mac OS, just go and buy a fucking Mac. They're built for the OS, and you won't have a hassle installing it.<br />
<br />
Also, I REALLY don't think that this is gonna save ya from malware. I'm sure there are Mac OS viruses out there too, but I ain't sure as I haven't used a Mac in a while. (maybe like, 8 years). I'm just assuming that it does, as Linux even has viruses. Just be safe on the Web, install an adblocker, and stay the fuck away from Internet Explorer, and you should be safe. If you want to dual-boot Windows with another OS, use Linux instead. It's free, isn't too resource intensive, and the NSA isn't using it to spy on you.

Yeah...OS X is definitely not super-clean, OS X malware such as MacCleaner is pretty common.<br />
<br />
If anything, it should be the other way around. OS X has Final Cut Pro, and much more reliable...cracks....for software like Photoshop.

Macs, especially the newer MacBooks, are insanely expensive. But of course, that depends on OP's budget.<br />
If anything, buy the mid-2012 13-inch MacBook Pro with a 500 GB HDD. &#36;1099 is a bit too much, but it's my personal recommendation.<br />

Also, it's good to mention that Hackintoshing is a pretty hard thing to do (at least with Tonymacx86 - I heard that myHack is easier)<br />
<br />
You have to make sure you get all the right kexts or something like audio or networking won't work properly. That's never good.

My laptop is more than half the price, yet it's still a better value because Windows master race.<br />

Yeah, count that too. It also depends on your hardware and if it's supported by OS X.<br />
Some people got OS X to run on AMD hardware, though.

I personally wouldn't recommend it. Firstly, AFAIK Hackingtoshing is pretty damn hard, so the failure chance is high. Secondly, your argument about no viruses/malware being on OS X is completely invalid, since OS X also has malware, crapware and adware, look at MacKeeper for example. If you so desperately want OS X, then you have to buy a Mac, Yes, they're expensive as hell, and yes, you might not have the money, but it's the only good way to get OS X.

My desktop cost me &#36;500 and beats the shit out of the family iMac. For &#36;1,000ish they got a dual core i5, 4 gigs of RAM, a 128 GB SSD (Less space for speed =/= better IMO) and an AMD HD graphics.<br />
<br />
For &#36;500 I got a quad core haswell i5, 8 gigs of RAM, and 2 TBs of hard disk on a 10000RPM hard disk drive. The only downside is that I have crappy integrated graphics, but it's a desktop made by somebody other than apple, so it can be opened up and have a dedicated GPU chucked in, unlike apple which in these days, you're stuck with what you buy. (AKA not able to be upgraded by the user).<br />
<br />
Also hackintoshing is not really worth your time. You'll probably run into hardware issues with some new piece of hardware that OS X doesn't support, nor will some of the hackintosh drivers. Obviously though, OS Xs creation tools are decent, but even then nothing can really compare to vegas for Windows. But of course, vegas is expensive as fuck, and AFAIK Final Cut pro is free or really cheap.

On the general topic of Hackintoshing, I could recommend rampagedev, but I think that is for desktops only...
