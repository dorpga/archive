<br />
Hi, I'm lordfundarbyrd. I used to be known as Delracman. I'm 14 and I've been around since May 2014, a week or so before my 12th birthday. I'm been semiactive over the past year but I don't log on very often, but I've been hanging around Discord and IRC a lot. I'm also known as the person who keeps getting more Chromebooks (or Crapbooks) but I have a Windows laptop now so it's all good.

<br />
Hello guys, it's been nearly a godammed year and a half, but I have returned.<br />
<br />
So I guess I'll introduce myself, my name is Ethan, and I am 14 years old.<br />
<br />
I joined this forum in April 2014, about 4 months before my 12th birthday, and I pretty much used this religiously for nearly a year, then in April 2015, I suddenly dropped off the face of the earth, coincidentally thats when I started to use reddit a lot. I decided to log in with my account today after seeing an email from raytron (lmao) in my inbox and joined the discord.<br />
<br />
And yeah thats it
<br />

<br />
Hi, my name is Jelle &lt;REDACTED&gt; and I am currently 15 years and 11 months old, so I'll almost turn 16. I live in this shitty country called the Netherlands, which is part of the even shittier European Union. I started browsing the OSFT Forums in December 2013, and I made an account in February 2014. I didn't post anything for a while though, I started being active in October 2014, because I was shy as fuck back then. Lately I started to become more active on Raytron, simply because I couldn't get used to anything else than myBB or phpBB. <br />
<br />
And oh yeah, I'm a moderator here.<br />
<br />
That's it for today folks, see ya later.

Most of you know me, I'm Raini Skies, also known as Lily (or Muffin if you know me from somewhere else). I feel like I don't have anything about me you guys wouldn't know.

Hi.<br />
<br />
I am DJ Deedahx, a horrible shitposter and IRC network owner, and I've been proudly posting on this forum as a whole since 2013, I guess?<br />
<br />
I dunno. Most of you know me by now.

<br />
Hello, just made a new account as I probably think my old account is long gone...<br />
I used to be known as "Polygon6789" when this forum was at tech-talk.ml or if you go further back, the OSFT forums.<br />
<br />
I remembered the forums and people I met there so it took me almost 2 hours to find the new forums due to URL and name changes... hopefully I'll be more active on here now. Feel free to message me if you want, I'm always willing to talk!
