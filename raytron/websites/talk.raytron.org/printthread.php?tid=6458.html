Yep. It's built. I'm calling it the Nerdcave Superstation 5000.<br />
<br />
The specs I've mentioned in my goodbye post have been temporarily downgraded. Everything's the same, except for the RAM and video card.<br />
<br />
RAM: 4GB (only because my dad''s old PC had 4 sticks, each 2 GB, but the motherboard has slots for only 2 sticks. Will be getting 8GB fairly soon.)<br />
GPU: Onboard Graphics on AMD A10 CPU. Sadly, the external video card overheated itself to death, but the onboard graphics are better than the external GPU, so yeah. Not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Still stuck on Windows 7, and as you may know I fucking HATE Windows 7. Gotta let her activate then I'm upgrading to Windows 10 :3

What case are you going to use? I chose a Bitfenix Colossus for my build back in 2013 (I still use it as my main PC now! But it's packed away...) but now it seems overly flashy. I wish I chose something more understated and elegant...maybe a fractal design case?<br />
<br />
Are you going to use any fancy coolers and overclock? I still haven't with mine (I really should, maybe this winter when I get into a house with the space). You could possibly crossfire the APU with a dedicated GPU, although I don't really know how AMD technologies work. Maybe that's impossible.

I don't know the model of the case. All I know is it's recycled from an Acer.<br />
<br />
I still don't have the panel that covers it's guts installed yet...<br />
<br />
As for any fancy stuff, no. Everything runs fairly cool already even under load, and the CPU clocks in at over 3GHz without overclocking so no fancy cooling or overclocking is needed.<br />
<br />
And, I have an external fan cooling the entire room 24/7, and since the guts are exposed it shouldn't get too hot... but idk

I only have a 1080i tablet camera and no way of getting images off the tablet, so I can't really show pics... sorry

You're making it sound like Michael didn't even put effort into buying for his build. At least he made an AMD-powered build, so please be happy about it.<br />
