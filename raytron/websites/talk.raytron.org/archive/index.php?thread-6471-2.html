Do I need plain english?<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>soulman Wrote:</cite>Micro-ATX boards have 4 I/O slots (PCI-E, PCI etc).<br />
ATX boards have 7.<br />
<br />
Micro-ATX boards fit in ATX cases but ATX boards do not fit in Micro-ATX cases.</blockquote><br />
Hmm... Well then I have a PCI-E x16, A PCI-E x1 and a Mini PCI.<br />
<br />
However, I'm going to do some measurements and google the results. But after doing some research and talking to some people, I am almost positive it is a Micro ATX, but to confirm I will need to measure. Knowing asus, I doubt they're one to use a non-standard form factor like FlexATX or BTX. Dell and HP on the other hand, :roll:<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Update:</span><br />
<br />
It's a flexATX motherboard. Took the measurements and it came out as 9" x 7.5" aka flexATX. Hopefully it will still fit into a standard size ATX case.</div>

Any user who visits techTalk and doesn't know a lot about computer hardware might need plain English.<br />

Of course it will. The Bitfenix Neos, for example, is long and deep enough (7.3 x 16.9 x 18.5 in) to fix your mobo in.</div>

<div class="message">Update:<br />
<br />
Putting this project on hold until either I get a new job (more likely) or I get more hours at my current job (less likely).<br />
<br />
Outside of this project, I did order an SSD and it got here on tuesday night, but I have yet to install it.<br />
<br />
Outside of the ssd, I might upgrade to 2400 MHz RAM or just get an extra 8 gig stick at 1600 MHz so I can have dual channel support. <img src="https://talk.raytron.org/images/smilies/tongue.png" alt="Tongue" title="Tongue" class="smilie smilie_5" /></div>

<div class="message">I would get the extra stick of 8GB RAM if I were you. You wouldn't benefit that much from from faster RAM. See <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=dWgzA2C61z4" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">here.</a></div>

<div class="message">Sometimes there's no advice more poisonous than that seen on LTT, though there is a valid question raised. Depending on how intensive you use your memory then you can justify the extra bandwidth offered by faster memory (or a different memory platform such as DDR4). If all you do is sit and game at 1080 (like the majority of LTT viewers) then no, you'll more than likely not see much of a benefit.</div>

Seeing KomputerKid's specs, it seems to be purposed for gaming. He would benefit from having 16GB RAM.</div>

Exactly. All I do is Game, Internet, IRC, and CAD.<br />
<br />

Mostly gaming, but also CAD yes.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to take the suggestion from soulman and get a fractal design at some point in time.<br />
<br />
I have installed the SSD, but all I have to do is backup my personal files, and then re-install windows onto the SSD. I've just been lazy.</div>
