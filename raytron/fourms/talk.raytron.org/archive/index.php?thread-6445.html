<div class="message">I don't mind Windows 10 so far. My only problem is that the transition time between starting Windows 10 and logging in is a little longer. I just have to watch the dots just go in circles and circles and...circles... Well, I guess I do have another problem. The taskbar. After upgrading from Windows 8.1, I saw that they just threw a shit ton of crap on my taskbar. I got rid of Task View (or whatever that stupid thing is), search bar... You get the point. Only bugs I have encountered are only in the Settings app. I went to go choose a different picture for my background and two times after trying to browse for a picture, it closes on me. Microsoft didn't have to release Windows 10 so soon. There are still a lot of things that need to be fixed, but I guess they'll just give us a huge fucking load of updates. I rather have something that I can depend on even if it'll take a little longer for a release.<br />

Oh, one more thing. Cortana can be a bitch at times. In fact I called her a bitch and she sent me to Bing searching for "Cortana you're a bitch".</div>

I tried telling her to Fuck off, and it took me to bing and the first result was Facebook. :lol:<br />
<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness, I'm not gonna use her until Microsoft adds support for other search engines. Think about it. If we boycott it until Microsoft adds support for things like Google and Yahoo, they'll have to fall to consumer pressure, right?<br />
<br />
Although, I've already used her to help me setup a few reminders, because I'm a lazy ass.</div>

Telling her to shut up doesn't help either. She always tells me that she was programmed to have the last word.<br />

You are aware this is Microsoft, aren't you?<br />

I haven't tried that. Shit Skynet is taking over <img src="https://talk.raytron.org/images/smilies/wink.png" alt="Wink" title="Wink" class="smilie smilie_2" /><br />

Yes, and I'm pretty sure they've bowed to consumer pressure before... like in the 90s. You're right, we're doomed to use cortana with bing.<br />

Also, if you want regular title bars that aren't white in Win10, follow <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-change-title-bar-color-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">this guide.</a> Make sure to open notepad.exe as an administrator. <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/497761/how-can-one-make-the-title-bar-text-buttons-have-better-contrast-on-dark-colors/497768#497768" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">You can use this to change the text colour.</a><br />

Minecraft: Windows 10 edition is a trainwreck. It's written in C++, which is great, I guess. But it requires a Microsoft account with an Xbox gamertag. If Microsoft continues to gravitate towards a more closed, Xbox-based Minecraft, then Minecraft could completely disappear from the Linux platform. It seems as if 1 year down the line, the Java edition could be completely obsolete.<br />
<br />
Yeah, Minecraft is dead.</div>

<div class="message">What I think about Windows 10: -10/9 nein<br />
<br />
- Recently mentioned on IRC by phillips1012 (aka |): Windows 10 is full of spyware, including Cortana. It's pretty much unnecessary right now. So unnecessary it makes Windows 8.1 Update look like Windows 7 with Modern UI.<br />
<br />
- DirectX 12 doesn't add much to the gaming experience, other than that it works better with your GPU or something... Not needed.<br />
<br />
- Microsoft Edge as the FORCED default browser. I suppose Bing is FORCED default search engine is well. Nope.<br />
<br />
Not planning to upgrade until someone who already has it lets me try it out, then I will wait until Christmas to upgrade. Gotta let the bugs get fixed.<br />

Since when? I can disable Bing in the taskbar, and Mozilla Firefox is my default browser.</div>

So basically the only problem is that they're not preserved during install? I don't see why that's such a big deal. The end user can easily launch Firefox or Chromium or something and click one button to make it the default.<br />
<br />
I installed Windows 10 as a fresh copy so I was not aware of this issue.</div>
