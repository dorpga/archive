It has these features that I got from Wikipedia:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>Compared to Thunderbolt 2, Intel's Thunderbolt 3 controller (codenamed Alpine Ridge) will double the bandwidth to 40 Gbit/s (5 GB/s), halve power consumption, and simultaneously drive two external 4K displays (or a single external 5K display) instead of just the single one current controllers can drive. The new controller will support PCIe 3.0 and other protocols, including HDMI 2.0, and DisplayPort 1.2 (allowing for 4K resolutions at 30 Hz). Being a USB 3.1 port, a Thunderbolt 3 can also provide up to 100 watts of power, which should allow companies to eliminate the separate power cable from some devices. Thunderbolt 3 will allow backwards compatibility with the first two versions by the use of adapters.</blockquote>

This seems really interesting. This is a demo of an external graphics card running through Thunderbolt 3:<br />

<br />
Also, Intel (sorry DJ) seems to be taking the lead in this development. Apple doesn't have as much involvement as they did with Thunderbolt 1 and 2. So, we'll most likely see this on Apple and non-Apple hardware at the same time.<br />
<br />
Another idea also just came to my head. The total number of PCI-E slots has for now been restricted by your motherboard. Now, could I install a Thunderbolt 3 card, and hook more PCI-E devices to it? I mean, that's probably impossible.</div>
