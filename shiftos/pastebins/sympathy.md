[6:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I don't want to lose my only friends
[6:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I don't want to lose ShiftOS
[6:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm going to tell you a secret that not even my best IRL friend knows about me.
[6:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: Not even my parents.
[6:48 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: You, and ShiftOS, are the only reason I'm still holding on.
[6:48 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: And if you can't tell what I'm trying to say
[6:49 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I don't know how I can say it in any way without... I don't know.
[6:49 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: At times I wonder why I'm even here.
[6:49 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: why I even belong on this planet
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and then I think about ShiftOS
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and see all the people who actually enjoy what I'm doing
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and that keeps me happy
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I get a little protective when I think about ShiftOS being compromised the way it was.
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and then I do shit I regret.
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: but you probably won't listen to this
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and that's fine. I'll just go to sleep tonight with this shallow feeling in my chest.
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'll live through it
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: just like I lived through 14 years of hell.
[6:52 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: but if you do summon the courage to forgive me
[6:52 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and you actually care
[6:52 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: you may actually be the best friend and greatest person I've ever met on this planet.
[6:53 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and please
[6:53 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: please
[6:53 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm begging you
