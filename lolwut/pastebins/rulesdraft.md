1. Please keep the general retardedness of #lolwut to a minimum, this is not #lounge.
 
2. Please do not express extreme fanboyism.
 
3. Please do not exceed the flood limit on this channel (the flood limit is 10?? lines).
 
4. Please do not exploit others (unless of course you fancy a permachannelban).
 
5. Please be respectful to the other members and staff if you want to be treated the same.
 
6. Please do not talk about |, techdom/raytron/techtalk, and shiftos on #lolwut (these discussions have caused unnecessary drama).

6. For the love of god, use common sense please.
 
 
Please Note: These rules are subject to change; thereâ€™s no excuse for not keeping up to date with the rules.
 
Also Note: You are grandfathered if you break an amended rule granted you broke it before the rule was amended.
