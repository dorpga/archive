<div class="message">The new MacBook Pro is indeed just ew, you need adapters for literally everything. And that flashy new "Touch Bar" I see little use for to be honest, function keys are just more ....functional imho. As for the Surface Studio, it's even more overpriced than the iMac already is.</div>

<div class="message">Here are my thoughts. I was going to share them before but decided to hold off.<br />
<br />
Apple is trying to "innovate" too early in my opinion. It's like my opinion on the headphone jack- it's going to be replaced with something better in the future but the industry isn't ready for it yet. It's the same with the USB-C ports. It's starting to be used more but everything is still USB-A. The industry isn't ready yet for complete USB-C usage, hence the adapters. I also think the Touchbar has no real use. I don't really see why Apple thought it was necessary. I guess Touch ID is nice but also not necessary. On my Surface Book, the camera recognizes my face and logs me in. I don't need to touch my keyboard or mouse. With Touch ID, I still have to touch my computer. By the time it reads my fingerprint, I might as well type in my password. With the camera at least I don't need to touch my laptop.<br />
<br />
As for the Surface Studio, I do believe it is overpriced but does look cool. Just based off of reviews, apparently the hinge on it is very well done and the fact that the actual computer components are built into the base rather than the monitor. However the Surface Dial appears to have no real use. It works on Surface Book so I may ask for one for Christmas to test it out. Other than that there aren't really any other thoughts for me to have.</div>

<div class="message">Well I just watched a review of the surface studio. It looks like a neat device, but it's a bit pricey. The new MBP is just a giant rip off, overpriced, underpowered pile of shit. For &#36;500 you can get yourself a decent laptop with a dual core i5 and 8 GB of RAM, or a nice desktop with a quad core i5 and 8 GB of RAM. A Mac Mini (Apple's cheapest Mac) is starting &#36;600 and only offers a dual core i5, 4 GB of RAM, and a meager 250 GB SSD, with no room for extra hard drive slots. I've pretty much decided Apple is for hippie (or hipster) millennial kids with rich ass parents who buy everything for them, and that my Mid 2010 MBP will be the last apple device I ever own, and even that is slowly on it's way out the door, this spring when/if I get an internship at a firm. I will probably start hunting for a decent Lenovo Thinkpad or Dell Latitude at that point.</div>

<div class="message">OK, here's my take on the situation. I'm the sort of person that will throw money on something if it's a good solution and benefits me or makes my life easier. Normally I would praise Apple laptops and sure, the MBP does have its benefits.<br />
<br />
The touchbar is incredibly useful if you use creative apps regularly. Remember the days when you had to buy keyboard covers to highlight the key combos for one particular app? Gone are those days thanks to the fact you can have those and they're always contextually adjusting.<br />
<br />
The lack of USB-A really doesn't bother me either. I rarely use a USB-A drive and if I do on the rare occasion - big deal, an adapter. For USB-A devices with cables - a cable is being plugged in anyway, a shorter one on the end of it won't make a huge impact. Besides, USB-C is becoming more widespread meaning if you really want to cheap out, you can grab a 3rd party adapter. What's nicer is that Thunderbolt over USB-C has been adopted so you could essentially start doing the elegant 1 cable docking solution while charging over USB-C. Connect to a PCI-E device [hardware and software support provided], a large thunderbolt display like the LG Ultrawide or whatever, have your peripherals all connect via 1 cable. That situation of affairs really doesn't bother me in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Space grey finish too. I damn well like space grey.<br />
<br />
Here are my real complaints though:<br />
<br />
-RX460 graphics in the dGPU MBP. Why are we flogging the dead horse Apple? We all know OpenCL is a terrible architecture for compute performance because of the rigorous open standards it has to adhere with to make it accessible to anything with compute performance. I'd rather stick with a closed platform CUDA solution because the performance is greater and Pascal is a more efficient architecture.<br />
<br />
-Only 16GB RAM? That's lost me as a customer ultimately. My next laptop will most likely be the refresh of the Dell XPS 15" line. The RAM limitation held me back from buying an MBP last year and they year before, and it's done it again. 16GB is simply not enough for my virtual machines. As much as I like my cloud solution, it's impractical when I don't have the resources to pull a snapshot and run it locally.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, higher end PCs have always had exclusivity to them so things at this end of the market tend to be irrelevant to price itself, but rather how elegant the overall solution is. Sure, the MBP is an elegant solution, but it's an elegant solution to yesterday's market with the hardware specification. Give me extra RAM and more GPU compute performance, then we'll talk Apple. I find myself thinking the same with the Surface Book - which is no different in specification or price to the MBP either. As far as I'm concerned, Dell are still leading the market on a high performance notebook that is also designed as an elegant solution to multiple problems/markets.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can get a &#36;500 laptop to cater for some things, but it's not an elegant solution. You can pay &#36;5000 for a car to get you from A to B. It's functional, it works but the lacking of features and design elements would make it less desirable to drive for a very long distance compared to a higher end &#36;15,000 car, i.e. it might not be as comfortable. Sure, it still gets you there, but you might feel tired or have back ache for example. Complaining the Surface Studio/Surface Book or MacBook Pro is expensive is just the same old Lexus versus 20 year old Honda Civic argument. It's really not that different.</div>

<div class="message">I think the only reason the touchbar was made was to be flashy and gaudy and honestly as a user of Neovim it just won't even work out for me.<br />
<br />
And as for the Surface Studio, I couldn't care less about it. It's a functional computer (with an esc key btw) with a touchscreen that works well, but I won't be needing it as my Wacom Intuos tablet works just fine. Of course I haven't seen anything other than the commercials they air on television so I don't know much about it, but I imagine it's a good device thingy.</div>
