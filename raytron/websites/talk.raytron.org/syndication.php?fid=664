			<description><![CDATA[Just curious as to what everyone got/did for Christmas. I'll start:<br />
<br />
For "Christmas" (the one we have about 10 days before actual Christmas with my grandparents) I got a bluetooth speaker, a pair of jeans, and a green shirt.<br />
<br />
For actual Christmas, I got a bunch of clothes, a Raspberry Pi 3 B kit, a phone dock, a set of 7 colorful socks, another pair of socks, a bag full of chocolate, a pair of gloves, a tech magazine, chocolates, a thing of shampoo + body wash, a Raspberry Pi 3 Guide, and I also bought myself a few late Christmas presents, including an iPad dock, Core 2 Quad Q6700, 4 GB DDR 2 RAM, a MicroATX board, an R7 350, and some thermal paste.<br />
<br />
For my Birthday (which is 9 days before Christmas) I got a pair of athletic shorts and an athletic shirt and athletic shoes, reflective stickers for my helmet and shoes, a spare rear light for my bike, and &#36;140.<br />
<br />
I spent most of Christmas at my grandparents cabin, sleeping, because I had worked for 6 days in a row prior to Christmas and I was exhausted. I missed Christmas dinner unfortunately. <img src="https://talk.raytron.org/images/smilies/sad.png" alt="Sad" title="Sad" class="smilie smilie_8" />]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Since Donald Trump has won, I am curious to see who everyone truly supported for POTUS.<br />
<br />
I am not a Trump supporter personally. I just voted for him more out of a "Hillary needs to be in jail, and voting 3rd party is a waste of time" standpoint. The person I would have actually liked to see win, is Jill Stein, but of course, I know that would probably never have happened, and probably never will happen.]]></description>
