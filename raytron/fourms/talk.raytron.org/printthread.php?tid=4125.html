THIS IS NOW A FORUM RECORD! Woo-hoo!<br />
<br />
You know those comment chains on YouTube? In some, there's even hundreds of comments. If they can do it at YouTube, we can probably do it here. So, rules:<br />
<br />
1. If you don't quote the person above you, you'll break the chain.<br />
2. You can post anything you like in the reply's, just nothing offensive.<br />
<br />
OK, I'll start:<br />
<br />
I really like :linux: . I also really like :arch: and :mint: . Also  :debian: and :android: .
