[1:43 PM] Carver: ok
[1:44 PM] Carver: what do you want
[1:44 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm in a bit of an awkward situation.
[1:44 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: Drama that is far worse than any of the drama between me and you.
[1:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I'm not sure what to do
[1:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm paranoid
[1:46 PM] Carver: about what
[1:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: do you happen to know/remember cherryblue
[1:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: or the blimpy stuff
[1:46 PM] Carver: yes
[1:46 PM] Carver: and how you got triggered beyond belief(edited)
[1:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: yeah, but here's the thing
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: do you know about AstralPhaser Central
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: if not
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well
[1:47 PM] Carver: yes, my alt is on it
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: oh really?
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: anyways
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: those guys, blimpy etc
[1:47 PM] Carver: i havent been on it in a month
[1:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they're going to attack the next chat tomorrow
[1:48 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the one that's getting recorded and uploaded by Phil
[1:48 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they're going to try to fuck with me and him
[1:48 PM] Carver: which chat
[1:48 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: can't explain how
[1:48 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well Phil does these weekly chats
[1:50 PM] Carver: 1sec(edited)
[1:52 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: ...you're not leaking to them are you?
[1:53 PM] Carver: what would i leak
[1:55 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: these DMs, the fact I know their plans
[1:55 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the way I found out was a way that could set off some fucking red flags
[1:55 PM] Carver: wat did you do this time
[1:56 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well...
[1:56 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I have eyes...
[1:56 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: everywhere...
[1:56 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: 4 of them...
[1:56 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: 6 actually.
[1:57 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I can see everything that those fuckers who are planning the attack are talking about
[1:57 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: every single message, every single image
[1:57 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and, you know what?
[1:57 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I've learned that not one, but two ShiftOS moderators
[1:57 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: are leaking the staff lounge to the bad guys
[1:59 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the point is
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I've got a shiftos mod and a shiftos dev spying on me and leaking to the bad guys
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and the bad guys
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: their goal
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: is to make me shit my pants metaphorically in a bad way
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they want ShiftOS to die
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and they want Philip Adams to...hmm...
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well not die of course..
[2:00 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: but they don't want him to be famous.
[2:01 PM] Carver: i know that blimpy does not hate osft
[2:01 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: if I ban ANYONE who's involved in this for the reason that they're involved, ShiftOS and APC are fucked
[2:01 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: simple as that.
[2:01 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: @Carver yeah, but Cherry does, and so does everyone else in their community
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I can round off a list of people YOU know that WERE PART of the community and STILL ARE
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: that are bad
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: TheRandomMelon
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: Jelle
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: CherryBlue
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: nerd73
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: those are just some of them
[2:02 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the others
[2:03 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I don't know their usernames yet.
[2:03 PM] Carver: wait Jelle?
[2:04 PM] Carver: whos cherry
[2:05 PM] Carver: ?
[2:06 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: V-, coarsedesires, whatever you wanna call him
[2:08 PM] Carver: oh, Villus. He seems to know him but I don't think i know him
[2:09 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: Villus IS Chwrry.
[2:09 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: his current name is "V"
[2:10 PM] Carver: Jelle and TheRandomMelon are on that list?
[2:10 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: yes
[2:10 PM] Carver: how?
[2:11 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they're SPIES
[2:11 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they're LEAKING EVERYTHING
[2:11 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: how do I know?
[2:11 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: Well a certain happy face is one of my sets of eyes...'
[2:12 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: he has been leaking ALL of their conversations on the rogue servers about ShiftOS
[2:12 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and APC
[2:12 PM] Carver: fixylol?
[2:12 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: he's... not just... a blue happy face.
[2:13 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: do you need more help
[2:13 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: figuring out who this blue happy face is
[2:14 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: hint...
[2:14 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: victor tran...
[2:14 PM] Carver: oh him
[2:15 PM] Carver: all i have to say is dont go crazy and start drama, just wait it out
[2:15 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the thing is
[2:15 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm not the one starting the drama here.
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: They're the ones that'll wreak havoc.
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I need a prevention method
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: to stop them dead in their tracks
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: to shut them
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: fuck
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: down.
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: permanently.
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: so that they don't do this to anyone
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: ever
[2:16 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: again
[2:24 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: anyways
[2:25 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I am really pissed right now and my hands are tied
[2:25 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I want to fucking arm myself to the teeth, get in their servers on my end and shoot the damn place up
[2:25 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: but like
[2:25 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm forced to lay back and take it
[2:25 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and it's not helping at all
[2:26 PM] Carver: that would be hypocritical
[2:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they're the ones who are fucking with my shit
[2:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and, by the best quote ever, "treat others how you want to be treated"
[2:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they want to fuck with me...
[2:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'll fuck with them.
[2:28 PM] Carver: you want to be fucked with?
[2:29 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: nope, but I'll reciprocate their actions toward me
[2:29 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I don't treat anyone unethically unless they're treating ME unethically
[2:30 PM] Carver: sorry but I am not going to help you as i am distancing myself from shiftos
[2:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: this isn't about shiftos anymore
[2:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: this is about my personal sanity
[2:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: you realize that when I go to bed I have to think about Jonny Ladouceur or something completely unrelated to all of this
[2:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: so that I don't end up having nightmares about all this drama
[2:32 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I can't code ShiftOS, can't do YouTube, or anything I like doing without the deep subconscious thought of all this drama
[2:33 PM] Carver: take a break
[2:33 PM] Carver: they can't phycilaly hurt you(edited)
[2:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well what the fuck am I supposed to do instead
[2:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: programming and shit is my only hobby
[2:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: ShiftOS is my life's work
[2:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well
[2:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: at least the modern engine is
[2:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm learning OpenGL because of it.
[2:35 PM] Carver: just take a walk
[2:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I've met so many brilliant people because of it
[2:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I don't want to walk away from it, even temporarily
[2:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: because I'll be walking away from my life
[2:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the only reason I'm still here
[2:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I'm serious
[2:36 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I have no friends in real life
[2:36 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I have no other talents
[2:36 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I have nowhere to go, nothing to do
[2:36 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the only time I'm not getting bullied is when I'm not fucking conscious
[2:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I can't just...walk away
[2:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I can't just lay back and take all of this
[2:37 PM] Carver: have you tried making friends
[2:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: it'll fucking give me a damn ulcer before I know it
[2:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: @Carver yes
[2:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I have
[2:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: it's not easy
[2:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: it just isn't easy
[2:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: too many people bully me
[2:38 PM] Carver: weird question: is youtube blocked at your school
[2:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: no
[2:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I listen to music all the time on it
[2:39 PM] Carver: is there any web block?
[2:39 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: ...dude I teamviewer into my dev PC
[2:39 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I bypass ALL their security
[2:39 PM] Carver: i know
[2:39 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and go right to my home wifi
[2:39 PM] Carver: but is there a web block at your school(edited)
[2:39 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: it's a blacklist block
[2:39 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: only prevents porn, piracy etc(edited)
[2:40 PM] Carver: Well, i got people to know about me by making a youtube proxy
[2:41 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: ...dude... I don't want to get involved with that stuff
[2:41 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I want people to know me for my true self
[2:41 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the intelligent programmer that I am
[2:43 PM] Carver: try getting to know people
[2:43 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: why, it's not like they care about me... even if I try to talk to them they just ignore me
[2:43 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I don't want to appeal to people who aren't into things that I am
[2:43 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: that's not a good match for me
[2:44 PM] Carver: almost all of my friends know nothing about programming
[2:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm too much of an introvert and an awkward person to make friends IRL.
[2:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: besides
[2:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the whole point
[2:45 PM] Carver: i am an introvert
[2:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: is that I don't want to walk away from doing what I love because of shitty drama
[2:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I shouldn't let that stop me
[2:45 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and I won't let that stop me
[2:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: i want to stop the shitty drama.
[2:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and show those fuckers that I am NOT one you can fuck with
[2:46 PM] Carver: ...by going into damage control mode
[2:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: whatever I've done so far they have no clue what I'm doing behind the scenes(edited)
[2:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: whatever me and the rest of the admin team have done
[2:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: has been successful
[2:47 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: because they have no idea that I know what they don't
[2:49 PM] Carver: they cant do anything
[2:50 PM] Carver: and neither can you

Says that he hates me behind my back
