<br />
So, I'm in art class and using one of the school's machines, booted into Linux. This dude is new and can't tell the difference between a USB stick and a CPU.<br />
<br />
Guy: Hey, what is that computer running? Windows 8?<br />
Me: No, it's just plain old Ubuntu.<br />
Guy: What is that Google?<br />
Me: It's not google, it's Duckduckgo.<br />
Guy: Oh, I only know how to use google. My dad works for the internet.<br />
Me: What? He works for an ISP or a website?<br />
Guy: Well, I get lots of free stuff like a PS3 and a DS.<br />
Me: O..kay then.<br />
Guy: What's your name?<br />
Me: Jacob. *I'm doing this just to make him angry* So..rumor has it that Linux 4.0 is going to be written in Python! (this is a rumour most of us know isn't true and is basically an IRL copy pasta at this point)<br />
Guy: What is that? A game?<br />
Me: Yeah, Linux 4.0 is going to be written in Python and support XNU/Darwin and CP/M system calls, and be compatible with S1-compliant music devices! (At this point I'm spewing nonsense and just trying to see what he says)<br />
Guy: Well, very interesting then! It sounds like you know what you're talking about!

Noob: *Messing around with the keyboard*<br />
Me: Dude, do you know if you do that, It can crash the computer<br />
Noob: No it won't<br />
Me: Do you know a thing about computers?<br />
Noob: Yeah<br />
Me: Whats a processor <br />
Noob: No, I'm talking about this *Taps on the monitor*<br />
Me: That's a monitor, it shows what the machine itself is doing then it projects to the monitor. So what is a processor?<br />
Noob: It processes things<br />
Me: *Facepalm* A CPU!<br />
Noob: Stop asking me that<br />
<br />
[Then the next day he said if you don't safely disconnect a removable device, it can't corrupt items. If it's moving stuff onto it, IT WILL]

This was when I used my old shittop and ran Ubuntu:<br />
<br />
Guy: What is that on your computer?<br />
Me: Ubuntu.<br />
Guy: I thought your favorite OS was Linux?<br />
Me: 0_o Ubuntu is Linux!<br />
Guy: Isn't Linux an Operating system?<br />
Me: Linux is a kernel.<br />
Guy: YOU'VE ENSLAVED AN ARMY COLONEL?<br />
Me: Lol no, a computer kernel is part of an OS.<br />
Guy *shouting into the fan vent*: HEY COLONEL! COME OUT! <br />
Me: Lol, stop, there's no colonel in there.<br />
Guy: You said Linux is Colonel.<br />
Me: Linux is a Kernel. It's a computer kernel.<br />
Guy: Oh I get it, there's army Colonel's who work for computers.<br />
Me: lol no. You don't know shit about computers. I'm done here.<br />

*kid walks up to me*<br />
Hey what are you doing?<br />
Using the Linux command-line...<br />
OMG UR HACKING!!!!<br />
No, I'm not, i'm just using the computer.<br />
BUT WHY DOES IT LOOK LIKE YOUR HACKING?<br />
How does it look like i'm hacking?<br />
THERE'S ONLY TEXT ON THE SCREEN!<br />
Yeah, it's called a command-line interface.<br />
BULLSHIT! YOU'RE HACKING! (In a more loud voice to grab attention)<br />
*more kids come to me*<br />
OMG YOU'RE TOTALLY HACKING!<br />
No i'm not, is programming a c++ command line program really hacking?<br />
YOU'RE GOING TO GET ARRESTED! ALL HACKING IS ILLEGAL!<br />
Not all hacking is illegal...<br />
TELL ME LEGAL HACKING!<br />
Ok, lets say you have a toy train. If you open it up, and modify it to go faster than the manufacturer originally intended, then you're hacking.<br />
*people finally calms down*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">But that's not hacking that's just modifying...</span><br />
that's hacking<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">oh</span><br />
*people finally leave me alone*<br />
*teacher comes up to me*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Those kids are telling me you're hacking, is this true?</span><br />
no.<br />
*looks at screen*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">oh, wow you ARE hacking!</span><br />
OH MY FUCKING GOD, FOR THE MILLIONTH TIME I AM NOT HACKING!!! YOU DUMB-ASSES DON'T HAVE A CLUE DO YOU? THIS IS CALLED A COMMAND LINE INTERFACE, IF IT HAS TEXT ON THE SCREEN, IT DOESN'T MEAN I'M HACKING!<br />
*i realize what i said to the teacher*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">.........</span><br />
i'm sorry..... heh, heh *fake smile*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">We're bringing your computer to the IT guy.</span><br />
*We go to the IT department, and she gives him the laptop*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">This child has been hacking, and we want to know what he hacked</span><br />
<span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">Um, he hasn't hacked anything, he's just using linux in a command line interface, he didn't do anything bad at all.</span><br />
*I look at my teacher like i told you so*<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">THIS IS SO NOT DONE, FOR NOW YOU GET A SUSPENSION</span><br />
*i'm thinking what the fuck?*<br />
<br />
Lesson learned, don't bring a computer to school with a bunch of retards.
