Created this thread because discussion about computer-aided mass surveillance keeps popping up everywhere.<br />
<br />
What do you all think of software on desktops and phones starting to actively spy on users and have backdoors to mistreat users? Specifically, the revelations by many about how Windows 10 implements spyware and an anti-piracy backdoor.

<br />
<br />
Basically for me and many other people I know both IRL and on the internet it plays out like this...<br />
<br />
I have plenty of real life friends who use Windows 10 as I do. I know plenty of people on the internet who use Windows 10. The fact is, yes the spyware can be a small hindrance, but what is the average user doing on their computer anyways? Not somebody like a power user, not even somebody who has to work on their pc for work, but the average user, aka a 60-70 year old grandma or grandpa, or even a stay at home mom. They're simply checking email, watching youtube, and rant about pointless shit on facebook or twitter. A chromebook I think would be a lot better for THAT situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for somebody such as a business user, who has to utilize certain software, that is where the chromebook falls short. Sure google docs is a very good competitor to microsoft office, and yes a lot of schools and businesses are utilizing that now, there is still other software they may need to use. Ala skype, a certain email program written for their business, or another program such as a custom office suite written for their business. Generally these programs would only work on a Windows based OS. Occasionally they may work on a Mac based OS, and RARELY on a Linux based OS. It all depends.<br />
<br />
Now for a power user. A power user can be defined as many things. For example a power user might be a hardcore gamer, or just a light gamer like myself. A power user might be a youtuber. He or she might be an IT guru. He or she might be anything you can think of that defines "power user". I consider myself a power user for 3 specific reasons. 1. I play games (A bit more frequently now, mostly to pass time between not work and "school". (With 50 bajillion quotes)) 2. I do work with video editing software and image editing software. Currently I utilize gimp because at least it's not MS Paint, but I myself would prefer a copy of photoshop for some extra features and potentially developing skills as a graphic designer. (Which is a field I am considering to mesh with internet design in my business.) 3. I'm from the "Tech" generation.<br />
<br />
I use Windows 10 myself. I use it because it gets the job done, and also because of games and it's the easiest way for me to connect with my friends and play my games. (Skype for Linux is just a giant mess. Steam for Linux sucks as well (ESPECIALLY when moving the steam directory on steam caused the system to recursively delete everything on every mounted media.) BUT it doesn't suck from the games perspective, Plenty of games on Linux thanks to steam. In fact 90% of my library is Linux compatible. The reason it sucks because the games run terribly due to poorly optimized drivers. Even the binary drivers are half-assed pieces of work.) Now I do agree the spyware is a problem. I actually currently use a local account for various reasons but one of the biggest being the spyware, but the other reasons mostly being related to me utilizing a desktop and not an actual tablet. Using a microsoft account is not only spyware heaven but it makes Windows feel like a tablet based OS. Again, the reasons I use Windows at this point is games and connecting with my friends. If the drivers were more optimized for Linux so games would run better, and if skype for linux actually worked properly, I would be on Linux as the 10% of games that aren't on Linux I could live without or dual boot/virtualize for.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will continue this when I get back from work... Stay tuned.

They write Word and Excel documents and maybe watch a little Youtube on the side. Not just for work (although most people do use their PC mainly for work), but also for school. <br />
<br />
Now, Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. only work on Microsoft Windows. You could use OpenOffice but many schools use DOCX or are just butthurt about Office for some reason (like mine). I personally think my school is a bit of a special case, 99% of people could get by with OpenOffice, however OpenOffice is still unpopular, and new PCs usually come with Windows pre-installed, unless they're made by Apple or System76 or something. So people will continue to use Windows, at least for about 5 years or so. It's popularity is definitely waning but Windows 7 has about 50% and Windows XP has about 10%. OS X, by comparison, has about 8%.<span style="font-size: 50pt;" class="mycode_size"><a href="http://gs.statcounter.com/#desktop-os-ww-daily-20150819-20150825-bar" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">(Source)</a></span><br />
<br />
Not all of those people, who are just concerned about sending their Excel spreadsheets to their pointy-haired boss, are going to know or have the time to learn about Windows 10's privacy violations. Webcams send a huge block of data (probably a picture of you) when you plug them in. Things that you type are sent to Microsoft's servers. A local account might fix <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">some</span> issues, but <a href="https://fix10.isleaked.com/" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">certainly not all of them</a>.<br />
<br />
They may not be mining data from a person who rips the OS apart and is super-cautious about privacy, but they're mining data from 100 million more who don't know what hell they've gotten into.<br />

Not necessarily. I don't know what kind of nutty school you're going to, but a big chunk of schools and colleges even are utilizing google docs. The universities here in Oregon actually prefer you to utilize google docs (Having talked to university students as well as university counselors I know this is fact), unless you're studying something like engineering, where Windows would be required anyways.<br />

Okay yes, I did look at that link and followed all of those steps. Even still pretty sure something like a webcam being plugged in and sending a picture of you to microsoft is a bit over the top. And furthermore, the only community on the interwebz that can put a face to my name is this one in the first place so. (I'm really really anonymous outside of this community).<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>maxell Wrote:</cite>They may not be mining data from a person who rips the OS apart and is super-cautious about privacy, but they're mining data from 100 million more who don't know what hell they've gotten into.</blockquote><br />
Those people usually aren't super cautious about privacy. I'm not really myself but I would still like to know I can use a computer without having this or that being done behind my back. I do think that the people who aren't super cautious about privacy are akin to the proles from 1984, aka as long as they have been placated by big brother (Microsoft) they will continue to be his sheep. Still a lot of people I know IRL are either on 7 or 8.1 and haven't upgraded to 10. But a lot of people I know IRL are on 10. And there's a few on 7 or 8.1 that say "Yeah I ain't upgrading."<br />
<br />
The point remains that this whole argument is pointless and the Linux and Windows communities should shut up and let people use what they want, and a small community like us shouldn't be involved in a flame war. I'm not discussing this anymore, but I know I probably won't be able to keep that promise as somebody will probably start another debate.

That's what we're talking about. The debate is simply if all this spying is unethical in any way. I believe it is.

<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>maxell Wrote:</cite>Webcams send a huge block of data (probably a picture of you) when you plug them in.</blockquote>Ok, lets be realistic here... when you plug a webcam into your system for the first time on Windows 10 it may send a large chunk of data to the Microsoft servers but this doesn't mean that it is a picture, in fact, why would they even want/need a picture in the first place?<br />
<br />
A company like this can't do much with a picture of you or anything else when you plug in your webcam. What this chunk of data probably actually is is a bunch of information about the hardware model/drivers being installed etc. That is the kind of information that Microsoft can actually use. Windows 10 probably sends a chunk of data about that same size every time you plug in <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">any</span> new piece of hardware so that they can know what hardware is being used the most on their systems so they can optimize drivers for that and so they can know if a piece of hardware is causing problems for people.<br />
<br />
People keep jumping to conclusions about things before properly thinking it through. Instead of always assuming the worst try and think of the most logical explanation for something first.

However, keylogging being done by Cortana is definitely true, as that information is right there in the control panel.

The main problem is that the data is getting in the hands of a huge target. Consider that the data could be leaked somehow; the Ashley Madison leak didn't have consequences for most people, but a leak of Microsoft's data would be devastating. I assume you would definitely not want webcam pictures of you tied to your personal account info posted publicly on the internet.

Again, I don't really believe in most of this, mostly the video and audio telemetry. Why? Well, if you're wondering why then you've obviously never fucking used an electronic before. If a webcam is unplugged, it can't see shit. If a microphone is unplugged, it can't hear shit. It's not like plugging it in is going to magically make it take a picture of you, or record your voice. Besides, what are the odds that someone is going to be talking when they plug in their mic? Yeah, I can understand talking AFTER plugging it in to test if it's working... Also, Not a lot they can do with a picture of you. They're not the cops. And that'd be the same for audio samples.

...If Windows wanted to simply test that it's working it wouldn't need to be sent to Microsoft's servers.<br />
<br />
And what if there was a leak of this data? As | said, that would be devastating.
