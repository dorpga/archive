Just curious, but now that we've changed hosting and domains, yet again 90% of the avatars are broken. Is somebody going to do something about it, or is it completely up to the users to re-upload their avatars? IMO it looks somewhat inconsistent. And yes I'm nitpicky. Deal with it.

I don't really notice it to be honest, but yeah, it is a bit of an issue IMO.<br />
Please V0rTeX, fix the avatars! They totally matter, or something.

I already reuploaded mine, so I'm fine with whatever the administration decides to do.

I don't use avatars, so I don't care

No avatar master race here.<br />
But since I do care a lot for you all, I have decided to sign your non-existent petition to V0rTeX to fix the avatars.

Locally stored avatars are on phillips, but he refuse to upload them probably due to his crappy internet. I can't do anything about it. I strongly recommend you to use third party image hosts such as imgur for your avatars/signatures.
