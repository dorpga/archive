<br />
Apple never ceases to amaze me, or the tech community in general.<br />
<br />
Recently, Apple sent out a few Apple TV developer kits to some developers to develop tvOS apps for the thing.<br />
iFixit was one of them, and they decided to tear down the Apple TV sent to them and post it online.<br />
<br />
Apple, being the draconian bitch company that it is, got very angry and took down iFixit's developer account, which resulted in iOS' iFixit app being gone off the App Store... maybe forever.<br />
<br />
You guys at iFixit are fearless... nice job violating the Non-Disclosure Agreement and leaking the sexy insides of that Apple TV...<br />
<br />
Now I seriously wonder: <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Why The Fuck Do Non-Disclosure Agreements Exist?</span> &#x26;t- thread coming soon<br />
<br />
Anyway, discuss here.]]></content>

Now if you really hated Android (and you buy yourself an iDevice), this app might seem to have an actual purpose.<br />

		<title type="html" xml:space="preserve"><![CDATA[ARIN Finally Runs Out of IPv4 Addresses]]></title>
		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://talk.raytron.org/Thread-Technology-General-ARIN-Finally-Runs-Out-of-IPv4-Addresses"><![CDATA[It is often said, "the Internet is running out of phone numbers," as a way to express that the Internet is running out of IPv4 addresses, to those who are unfamiliar with Internet technologies. IPv4 addresses, like phone numbers are assigned hierarchically, and thus, have inherent inefficiency. The worldâ€™s Internet population has been growing and the number of Internet-connected devices continues to rise, with no end in sight. In the next week, the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) will have exhausted their supply of IPv4 addresses. The metaphorical IPv4 cupboards are bare. This long-predicted Internet historical event marks opening a new chapter of the Internetâ€™s evolution. However, it is somehow anti-climactic now that this date has arrived. The Internet will continue to operate, but all organizations must now accelerate their efforts to deploy IPv6.<br />
<br />
the word start on a running track<br />
<br />
ARIN IPv4 Address Exhaustion<br />
<br />
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) delegates authority for Internet resources to the five RIRs that cover the world. The American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) is the Regional Internet Registry (RIR) for the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, and North Atlantic islands. ARIN has been managing the assignment of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and Autonomous System (AS) numbers for several decades. Each RIR has been managing their limited IPv4 address stores and going through their various phases of exhaustion policies. ARIN has been in Phase 4 of their IPv4 depletion plan for more than a year now. ARIN will soon announce that they have completely extinguished their supply of IPv4 addresses. <br />
<br />
At this point, the rules for how address resources are allocated will change. Address resource applicants may not get their justified request fulfilled and might be offered a smaller block or the choice to be added to a waiting list. This page documents the process for the waiting list for unmet IPv4 address requests. To review the unmet resource policies, consult the Number Resource Policy Manual (NRPM), check out section 4.1.8. However, when the supply of IPv4 address space drops to 0.00000, then there will be no more addresses to allocate. If IPv4 addresses become available, then the policies in the NRPM will dictate that they are given out based on the Waiting List for Unmet Requests method.<br />
<br />
IPv4 Exhaustion Predicted for Decades<br />
<br />
Predictions of IPv4 depletion date back to the early 1990s.  The IETF formed the Address Lifetime Expectations (ALE) Working Group in the mid-1990s to analyze the rate of IPv4 adoption in anticipation that this date would come.  IPv4 address supply concerns was the primary reasons the IETF wanted to create a new version of the Internet Protocol (IP). The IETF IP Next Generation (IPng) working group started their work around that time and the first IPng was drafted around 1993. In those early days of the Internet, no one could have predicted the tremendous growth of the Internet. The IETF created Internet Protocol version 6 and finalized the header format with RFC 2460 in 1998. Each year as the IPv4 Internet grew at breakneck speeds, transition to IPv6 had become more and more daunting.<br />
<br />
Prolonging IPv4â€™s Lifespan<br />
<br />
As the Internet began to grow, techniques like Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR) and Network Address Translation (NAT) were used to extended life-support for IPv4 for almost two decades. Now ISPs are looking at using Carrier Grade NAT (CGN)/Large Scale NAT (LSN) to further prolong the use of IPv4. However, many of these multi-NAT techniques cause problems for many popular Internet applications. We can expect that there will be other techniques contrived to keep the much-loved IPv4 protocol running for decades to come.<br />
<br />
No End in Sight for IPv4<br />
<br />
Few organizations are thinking about when they may eventually stop using IPv4.  Some enterprise organizations have not given IPv6 much thought and are not aggressively moving to implementing it. Organizations will not be able to transition right from using IPv4 to using IPv6 directly. The dual-stack transition technique is the dominant transition strategy (tunnels are to be avoided when possible). In other words, organizations are encouraged to use native IPv6.<br />
<br />
Even if an organization starts to deploy IPv6 immediately, they will still require the use of IPv4 for years to come. IPv6 may not have a large impact on an organizationâ€™s near-term IPv4 address constraints. Those few enterprise organizations are playing a dangerous "game of chicken" by ignoring IPv6. While, there are techniques for prolonging the lifespan of IPv4, organizations may end up with limited options. Going forward, organizations that require additional IPv4 addresses will need to request them from their service provider (provided they have any addresses left to lease) or purchase them on the open market. As IPv4 address blocks get traded around and split up, we can expect the Internet routing tables to become increasingly fragmented.<br />
<br />
Organizations that deploy IPv6 will be living in a dual-stack world for many years. During that period of using both IPv4 and IPv6 in parallel, organizations will likely incur increased operating expenses. Gradually, over time, the cost of running an IPv4 network will increase.<br />
<br />
Now What? Move to IPv6!<br />
<br />
So now that this Internet historic date of ARINâ€™s IPv4 run-out has arrived, we should review what our own organizations are doing to plan for the next phase of the Internetâ€™s lifespan.<br />
<br />
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should already be well on their way through their IPv6 deployments. If you work for an ISP that has not yet started your IPv6 deployment then you are in serious danger of falling far behind your competitors.<br />
<br />
If you are an enterprise organization, then your plans for the future need to be quickly defined and put into action. Your organization no longer has the option to continue to ignore IPv6.  However, your organization may be planning to invest in purchasing additional IPv4 addresses. Your organizations will be forced to tolerate the use of multiple-layers of NAT and the application problems that come with it.  Your organization will be forced to invest in larger Internet routers to be able to handle the rapidly expanding IPv4 Internet routing tables. Your organization should be planning for future years of legacy IPv4-Internet connectivity and actively moving toward full deployment of IPv6.<br />
<br />
If your organization is one of those that waited to embrace IPv6, then you are in luck, as there are plenty of resources available to help you with your IPv6 planning and deployment. While Wikipedia.org can get you started learning the basics, you should visit the Internet Society Deploy360 Programme IPv6 page. You should also explore ARINâ€™s own Get6 site. We wish you the best of luck configuring your systems so you can reach the "whole Internet" using IPv6 and not just the "old Internet" using IPv4.<br />

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://talk.raytron.org/Thread-Hardware-Open-to-suggestions-looking-for-a-better-pc-case"><![CDATA[I've decided that I'm just going to do a system transplant and move all of my PC components to a better case. There are 3 main problems I have with the current case I am using (a stock cheap OEM one)<br />
<br />
<ol type="1" class="mycode_list">
</li>
<li>The PCI Express covers and lock in system is beyond screwed up. Instead of having a screw in system like 90% of cases, it just has these metal notches that you need to slide under the pci express component. Hard as fuck to keep it in there in a stable manner.<br />
</li>
<li>There is NO cable management. All my loose cables from my power supply are hanging out in between the CD Drive and the Hard Disk. Not ideal<br />
</li>
<li>There is NO extra drive bays. Now this really surprised me about ASUS. Knowing how good asus is with user service and things like that I would have thought there would have been extra drive bays. I plan on potentially putting a solid state disk in here, so having an extra drive bay would be nice.<br />
</li></ol>
<br />
Any suggestions are welcome, and really all 3 of these things surprised me with an ASUS pc. I would have thought that knowing ASUS, they would at least use a screw in PCI Express  system rather than metal notches. Also no drive expansion bays? Seriously ASUS. Even dell and HP have entry level pcs with drive expansion bays. The cable issue wasn't AS surprising because it is a cheap oem case, but still shocked me.<br />
<br />
Any case suggestions welcome, I'm mostly looking for cable management and drive bays, because most cases if not all cases have a screw in pci express lock in system instead of crappy metal notches.]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://talk.raytron.org/Thread-Hardware-Is-my-SSD-dead"><![CDATA[Last Wednesday, I went out and got myself a 240GB SanDisk SSD Plus Solid State Drive and installed Windows 10 on it. It ran pretty well for the past few days as I installed Firefox, an anti-virus (avast!), and Office 2013. But when I turned on my PC with the SSD, I found myself with the 'Operating system not found' error. No matter how many times I reconnect the drive to the SATA port, it posts the same error. So, a dead SSD or maybe something that I can do to revive my &#36;150 SSD? Remember that this SSD is less than a week old.]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://talk.raytron.org/Thread-Technology-General-Thunderbolt-3"><![CDATA[I don't know why nobody is talking about this (it's sorta old news, actually), but Thunderbolt 3 is becoming a thing. Instead of using DisplayPort as a connector, it's using a USB C connector.<br />
<br />
It has these features that I got from Wikipedia:<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>Compared to Thunderbolt 2, Intel's Thunderbolt 3 controller (codenamed Alpine Ridge) will double the bandwidth to 40 Gbit/s (5 GB/s), halve power consumption, and simultaneously drive two external 4K displays (or a single external 5K display) instead of just the single one current controllers can drive. The new controller will support PCIe 3.0 and other protocols, including HDMI 2.0, and DisplayPort 1.2 (allowing for 4K resolutions at 30 Hz). Being a USB 3.1 port, a Thunderbolt 3 can also provide up to 100 watts of power, which should allow companies to eliminate the separate power cable from some devices. Thunderbolt 3 will allow backwards compatibility with the first two versions by the use of adapters.</blockquote>
<br />
This seems really interesting. This is a demo of an external graphics card running through Thunderbolt 3:<br />
<br />
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BFkp0GHz5v8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br />
<br />
Also, Intel (sorry DJ) seems to be taking the lead in this development. Apple doesn't have as much involvement as they did with Thunderbolt 1 and 2. So, we'll most likely see this on Apple and non-Apple hardware at the same time.<br />
<br />
Another idea also just came to my head. The total number of PCI-E slots has for now been restricted by your motherboard. Now, could I install a Thunderbolt 3 card, and hook more PCI-E devices to it? I mean, that's probably impossible.]]></content>

		<content type="html" xml:space="preserve" xml:base="https://talk.raytron.org/Thread-Gaming-General-YouTube-Gaming-Released"><![CDATA[Yesterday YouTube released YouTube Gaming, a gaming live streaming service that is supposed to compete with Twitch. <br />
<br />
I've been playing around with it, checking people out, watching streams, and it's pretty cool. It's definitely faster than Twitch and doesn't buffer as much (I didn't have buffering issues with Twitch, but I did have quality issues) It also has a large library of games that you can follow, more than I was expecting, actually. You can also watch videos by Gaming Youtubers that you can also watch on YouTube. The only thing I don't like is the layout. I like the Twitch app layout better. I find the YT Gaming layout a bit confusing, but I've been getting the hang of it.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: will it be successful? I believe so, since quality of the stream is better and it was released by YouTube. However, there are still a bunch of Youtubers streaming on Twitch, so I think it will be a while until they switch over, if they ever do. I don't believe YouTube offers subscriptions like Twitch does, which could keep people from switching for now. But overall, not bad for a first try YouTube.]]></content>

The specs I've mentioned in my goodbye post have been temporarily downgraded. Everything's the same, except for the RAM and video card.<br />
<br />
RAM: 4GB (only because my dad''s old PC had 4 sticks, each 2 GB, but the motherboard has slots for only 2 sticks. Will be getting 8GB fairly soon.)<br />
GPU: Onboard Graphics on AMD A10 CPU. Sadly, the external video card overheated itself to death, but the onboard graphics are better than the external GPU, so yeah. Not a big deal.<br />

Still stuck on Windows 7, and as you may know I fucking HATE Windows 7. Gotta let her activate then I'm upgrading to Windows 10 :3]]></content>
