Thanks to cloudflare, the caching and security reverse proxy techtalk uses, techTalk now has full SSL support. The connection between my server and cloudflare is encrypted, and the connection between you and cloudflare is encrypted when you use the https URL.<br />
<br />
I encourage you to use SSL so your account and your data is secure and immutable by an attacker.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Edit:</span> HTTPS is now forced on all pages

There is a problem with the siteâ€™s certificate as it is now and itâ€™s quite annoying. <br />
Every time I load the page this pops up:  <img src="http://grahamdowney.com/images/tech-talk.ml/certificate-errors.gif" alt="[Image: certificate-errors.gif]" class="mycode_img" /><br />
<br />
Please fix this problem soon or make SSL encryption optional for all pages except for the pages requiring a login. I do not believe it is necessary to use encryption on every page of a public forum as it is meant for people to access publicly and all the information there is free to use for every one. The only place where I see SSL necessary is where important information/data is being held, ex: login pages and pages with personal data.

Can you click "View certificate" and take a screenshot? You may have visited techtalk over SSL before cloudflare signed my certificate, and you need to clear your certificate cache.<br />
<br />
This is what the certificate should look like:<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9ZFje8a.png" alt="[Image: 9ZFje8a.png]" class="mycode_img" /><br />
If your browser's SSL cache is up to date, it should say it's issued for tech-talk.ml, and not a cloudflare dummy ssl placeholder url.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel SSL is very important to the free and open web, and using it as much as possible is an important step to stop all forms of digital privacy invasion.

I will try clearing my cache also then tell you if that fixes anything.

I think you need to install the Certificate before it can work. Depends on the browser, though.

Cloudflare does not support SPDY for free, and their SPDY to http proxying doesn't implement their DDOS protection and caching.<br />
<br />
Edit: wat, I don't even have a pro account<br />
