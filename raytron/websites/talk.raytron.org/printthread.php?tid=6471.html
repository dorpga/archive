<strong>Open to suggestions, looking for a better pc case</strong> - <a href="https://talk.raytron.org/User-Komputer">Komputer</a> -  <strong>09-19-2015</strong>
<br />
<br />
I've decided that I'm just going to do a system transplant and move all of my PC components to a better case. There are 3 main problems I have with the current case I am using (a stock cheap OEM one)<br />
<br />
<ol type="1" class="mycode_list">
</li>
<li>The PCI Express covers and lock in system is beyond screwed up. Instead of having a screw in system like 90% of cases, it just has these metal notches that you need to slide under the pci express component. Hard as fuck to keep it in there in a stable manner.<br />
</li>
<li>There is NO cable management. All my loose cables from my power supply are hanging out in between the CD Drive and the Hard Disk. Not ideal<br />
</li>
<li>There is NO extra drive bays. Now this really surprised me about ASUS. Knowing how good asus is with user service and things like that I would have thought there would have been extra drive bays. I plan on potentially putting a solid state disk in here, so having an extra drive bay would be nice.<br />
</li></ol>
<br />
Any suggestions are welcome, and really all 3 of these things surprised me with an ASUS pc. I would have thought that knowing ASUS, they would at least use a screw in PCI Express Â system rather than metal notches. Also no drive expansion bays? Seriously ASUS. Even dell and HP have entry level pcs with drive expansion bays. The cable issue wasn't AS surprising because it is a cheap oem case, but still shocked me.<br />
<br />
Any case suggestions welcome, I'm mostly looking for cable management and drive bays, because most cases if not all cases have a screw in pci express lock in system instead of crappy metal notches.

My personal recommendation would be the <a href="https://www.nzxt.com/product/detail/105-source-210-case.html" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">NZXT Source 210 Elite</a>, as it is quite an affordable case for around &#36;50-60. Dual 120mm front air intake, bottom-mounted PSU, tool-less hard drive mounting, etc. What's not to like, mate?<br />
There are two colors, Black and White. Choose to your liking.<br />
<br />
NOTE: If you want front USB 3.0, pick the <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Source 210 Elite</span>.

I have a friend who had the source 210. He hated it so much be got me to rebuild his PC in a new chassis. Build quality was questionable and there weren't very many cable management options in comparison to what I expected which was surprising for NZXT. Same friend also managed to murder the 210's front I/O by plugging a device in somehow.<br />
<br />
Full tower if you have closer to &#36;150: Fractal Design Define XL R2 &lt;- personally use it, glorious case and massive inside<br />
Mid tower if you like the XL R2: Fractal Design Define R4/R5 <br />
Other Fractal design cases to consider that cost less: Core 3500, Core 2500, Arc Midi R2, Arc Midi XL<br />
<br />
Other viable case options: NZXT H440 (if you don't have any optical drives), Corsair Carbide 100R, 200R, 300R, 330R, 400R, 500R, Corsair Obsidian 450D<br />
<br />
Highly recommend the Fractal Design options as they're probably one of the best designed cases I've seen and after using them I am a fan of the sound dampening. Should you get a Define series case you will not be disappointed.

<br />
Personal bias (because it's the one I own) Corsair 300R. Mid tower, not bad for cable management, I absolutely love it's looks.

You should get a HAF Stacker. The only reason is because those things are kinda weird and I don't really know what they are so I want you to tell me.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Bitfenix cases look pretty neat although they're not all that cheap. They work pretty well.

KK's components: Intel Core i5-4460, unknown form factor LGA1150 motherboard, 8 GB RAM, 2 TB HDD, Radeon R9 270X, Corsair CX500.<br />
HAF Stacker = unnecessary money spending.<br />

At least I can agree with you on this. I would highly recommended the Bitfenix Neos for that matter.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.bitfenix.com/global/en/products/chassis/neos/" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">Original edition</a> // <a href="http://www.bitfenix.com/global/en/products/chassis/neos-window/" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">Windowed edition</a>

Winner winner chicken dinner. You nailed the components right on the spot. The motherboard may be a microATX but I'm not sure. As said this is the biggest problem with the case transplant is not knowing what form factor my motherboard is. All I know is that it's made by ASUS and is probably one they use for their PCs and not one you can order in stores.<br />

As long as it doesn't go over &#36;150 I'm perfectly okay with a fancy case.

Yay <img src="https://talk.raytron.org/images/smilies/biggrin.png" alt="Big Grin" title="Big Grin" class="smilie smilie_4" /><br />
<br />
You know, if you take the motherboard out of the case, you can measure it (width x length) and post it so I can compare with other motherboards.

Micro-ATX boards have 4 I/O slots (PCI-E, PCI etc).<br />
ATX boards have 7.<br />
<br />
Micro-ATX boards fit in ATX cases but ATX boards do not fit in Micro-ATX cases.

In Plain English:<br />
<br />
Micro-ATX boards are smaller than ATX boards.
