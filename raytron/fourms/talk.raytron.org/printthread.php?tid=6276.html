techTalk as a forum has been suffering inactivity due to a lack of users wanting to use the forum over the IRC channel.<br />
<br />
In an attempt to revive the old forum community, major changes are going to take place in the next few months.<br />
<br />
"techTalk 3.0" will not use phpbb or mybb. It will use forum software written by the community from scratch in a way that it's heavily geared towards the type of community techTalk has been.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: xx-large;" class="mycode_size"><span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Original concept design</span></span><br />

O hai, techTalk is going through a rebirth again. Are we getting an open alpha once nothing in that checklist is 0%?

I'm not quite sure about the concept design "controversial" part. I understand you'll change it later, but maybe you could op for something that's more classical.<br />
<br />
Okay, never mind. Just don't take into account my suggestion unless you really like it. It'll damage TT forever.

Not sure exactly what you're saying. "Controversial" means sort by posts that have even amounts of likes and dislikes. I'll probably not add dislikes anyways, because they encourage post deletion and automatic censorship of unpopular opinions.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that the word "controversial" has a negative connotation and will drive users away? Because that's not how UX works...<br />
<br />

Public betas will be up as soon as possible.

You know what? Never mind.<br />
<br />
But if you don't add dislikes there'll be no "controversial" tab.

<br />
<br />
In case anybody is wondering I have a small FAQ:<br />
<br />
<ul class="mycode_list">
</li>
<li>Why are you doing this? An attempt to revive the old forum community.<br />
</li>
<li>Is it open source? Most likely it will be open source, as it is community made. If you are interested in helping feel free to join in.<br />
</li>
<li>What language will it be written in? I believe JS, but it could be Ruby.<br />
</li>
<li>What will it be like? It will kind of be like a giant subreddit, without the rest of reddit.<br />
</li>
<li>Will we still have our old login info? phillips1012 is going to see if he can export our login info from phpbb to the new site. If that is possible, when you first login to techTalk 3.0, you will be given the option to change your username and password (As long as it is community appropriate)<br />
</li>
<li>Why not use mybb? Because a bunch of separate boards on a community as small as ours doesn't really feel like a community.<br />
</li>
<li>What happens when you give up on this? Give up? What? We won't give up on this. Dahell are you smokin'?</li></ul>

<br />
<br />
If this is to revive the old forum community because of the community's preference towards the IRC, why post a link to the IRC from the start?
