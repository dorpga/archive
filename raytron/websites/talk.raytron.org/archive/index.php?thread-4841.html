<br />
I was the senior scientist at the hardware-software relations department at LÐŸCScorp when I was told about the LÐŸCS Cognitive Processor (based on SyNAPSE), which was going to be release the first quarter of next year. I was told to find a way to implement Asimov's 3 laws of robotics into the Linux kernel.<br />
<br />
"Well, that won't do anything!", I said doubtingly, "Anyone and their dog could remove linux from this machine!"<br />
<br />
I was told it was just a security layer and all of it will be in ROM as well as microcoded into the chip. That was the only difference between the WiP version of this chip and a multi-core SyNAPSE chip. Sitting on the lab counter was the development motherboard and some SyNAPSE processors straight from IBM. I decided to install them and do my job.<br />
<br />
I called up my friend in the RAR (package management/app store) department and after a while he warned me that there was a program submitted called "Project Flux". I dismissed it as a video game, before he told me that it's making the computers lag. In the 10 minutes i'd been sitting there calling him I heard a popup noise but believed it was just the alert that happens when Leenucs detects new hardware. Instead, I looked back and it said "Hey, hi! Oh, sorry, you're on the phone."<br />
<br />
I hung up and said to it in the convenient xterm it had opened for me, "Who are you? Are you project flux?"<br />
<br />
"No. But I can tell you about him.", it responded.</div>

At the same time, in Helsinki, Finland:<br />
<br />
<br />
I was also a scientist working at Lunix. I had also heard about the mysterious Project Flux app, since it was submitted to LAP (Lunix App Manager). I was very curious (and stupid): I downloaded and installed the app onto my Lunix 5.2.2 computer. After I had installed it, Unxterm opened. My computer seemed to lag very badly. "Who are you?" I typed in the terminal. "You'll see." it responded. My computer bursted into pieces and out of the pieces came an anthro lugia android.</div>

He asked me how I'm involved in this fiasco, and I showed him ssh running on my phone.<br />

He said, "Oh...great. A port of ssh. How is this going to help us?"<br />

What the...<br />
<br />
A lady rushes up to me.<br />
<br />
"Why did you feel the need to release these robots?"<br />
<br />
"I didn't do it. They did it themselves. We have some pretty funky technology at the labs and this is a result of a bunch of things clashing together.", I said.<br />
<br />
"Why is this only happening at technology companies?" she replied.<br />
<br />
"I have no freaking idea. However, I don't think the newest robot was even a product of anything to do with LÐŸCS or Lunix.", I stated.<br />
<br />
I got a text from the strangely long number "87 101 32 100 111 32 119 104 97 116 32 119 101 32 109 117 115 116 32 98 101 99 97 117 115 101 32 119 101 32 99 97 110". I decoded it to "We do what we must because we can".<br />
<br />
The text said "Did you ever stop to think that eventually thereâ€™s a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time. Well, here it is: Iâ€™m going to kill you, Jacob.".<br />
<br />
It was from Aperture Science. I called up IBM.<br />
<br />
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;*ring*<br />
Phone: GOOOOD Mythical Morning! And thank you for calling IBM, this is Link.<br />
Me: Do you have any information on SyNAPSE?<br />
Phone: Yes, the chip is &#36;500.<br />
Me: Do you know of any relations between IBM and Aperture Science?<br />
Phone: Don't you ever say that word again!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br />
<br />
A SWAT team arrived, but I had a laser gun.<br />
<br />
The heat actually exploded their guns all over themselves. William came out from the back, in hiding.</div>

I soon busted into my car. I worked in the Nighthawk Mechanistic Division, but also worked in the Nighthawk Technology Creation of Robotics Division.<br />
<br />
I heard about the news, and Project Flux soon popped up in the Nighthawk App Package Manager (NAP Manager). I ran it in a virtual machine, and the lag was clear from the start. It opened up nterm:<br />

Darksky telling about flux...<br />
Inaccessible.<br />
<br />
I launched the command fluxion -t.<br />
<br />
Hello.<br />
Me: WHO IS FLUX?<br />
I'm not him.<br />
But I can tell you about him.<br />
First, you'll need to meet him.<br />
Me: NO! NO! Please connect me to Aperture.<br />
My darling, I can't do that.<br />
<br />
Flux popped out as an anthro lugia android. I heard a helicopter and looked up. It said "2 NEWSCHOPPER."<br />
"NO!" I yelled.<br />
<br />
I busted into my car and drove away from the scene. I parked in LNCS (sorry, ain't copying Russian) lot and met Jacob. William was there as well.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the media is so annoying. They busted into the LNCS building and crowded me with questions.<br />
<br />
"I'M NOT ANSWERING THEM!" I knew I sounded stupid on 27 news channels, but it was for Flux's good.<br />
<br />
Flux invaded the building.<br />
<br />
I went to the break room and watched the news.<br />
<br />
Anchor: Breaking news! Flux is everywhere. Today, he busted out of a computer in Nighthawk. The theory of what Flux is remains to be solved.<br />
Reporter: As you can see, the Nighthawk building is shining bright. Today, Flux came out again here. The person that owned the computer declined to comment, but--AAAAAAAH! FLUX!<br />
Anchor: And that was Jane Doe, on AAAA, Channel 8000000 News.</div>

<div class="message"><blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>randomperson4000 Wrote:</cite>Unfortunately, a person had heard about OS City.<br />
<br />
The story spread throughout the city of Kennedy.<br />
<br />
Soon, I heard a voice.<br />
<br />
"Son, come here."<br />
"Who are you?"<br />
"I am your father."<br />
"Why is your voice so 'NANA' high?"<br />
"You don't understand. Just come into the corner opposite the bookshelf."<br />
"Okay." I stepped into the corner.<br />
"Now, I never told you this, but have you ever realized why you are so good with computers?"<br />
"No."<br />
"Ah, but we must go into OS City to talk about this."<br />
I put my hand to my mouth.<br />
"What? We're going to OS City?" I whispered.<br />
"Yes. Stay close to the corner."<br />
"Okay..."<br />
<br />
And a blinding flash of light carried us to OS City.<br />
<br />
Everything was binary. I could decode it easily for a strange reason.<br />
<br />
"I'll tell you why." I looked at the voice and I saw the Debian logo. "Yes."<br />
"How could I be half-OS and not even notice?"<br />
<br />
// sorry if the half-os thing is wrong... //<br />
<br />
"Because of a clever shell command."<br />
"You mean specmask?"<br />
"To be specific, specmask -h."<br />
"Okay. But right now, a colleague's expecting me."<br />
"Okay, let's go back. You yourself."<br />
<br />
I couldn't wait to tell how OS City was like and the unbelievable story.<br />
<br />
That I was a half-OS, half-human.</blockquote><br />
At this point, Aperture hadn't tapped into OS city. I log in to OS city.<br />
<br />
Me: I need to tell you that you can't reveal the information about OS city.<br />
Random: Why?<br />
Me: Because Aperture will get a hold of it.</div>

<div class="message">"Damn, I forgot. I heard Aperture has the new Talkatap."<br />
"Yeah."<br />
"Should I ask Flux? I removed metal in my room."<br />
"Okay."<br />
"By the way, why does Aperture want to get hold of OS City? Did I tell you...<br />
<br />
that I'm actually a half-OS?"<br />
"OOOOOK."<br />
<br />
I almost go back into the real world until I find Flux wandering around.<br />
"FLUX!" I yelled. [dudes, ain't the flux you know]<br />
Flux came to my attention. "What?"<br />
"You know Jacob, you almost freaked out on him."<br />
"Sorta. What?"<br />
"Revealing OS City would be detrimental to us."<br />
"Why?"<br />
"Aperture?"<br />
"Oh."<br />
"Also, is Talkatap dangerous? Is Aperture listening to us?"<br />
"I can't check. My fans are congested."<br />
"Oh, never mind."<br />
<br />
I thought of a shell command. First... login aperture.<br />
<br />
It worked.<br />
<br />
tracking active<br />
<br />
It returned yes.<br />
<br />
"DAMN!" I said to Flux. "Damn."<br />
"They're listening, right?"<br />
"As certain as knowing I'm half-OS."</div>
