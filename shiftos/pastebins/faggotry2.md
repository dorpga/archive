[4:04 PM] blimpy: fair enough
[4:04 PM] blimpy: v- especially is uh
[4:04 PM] blimpy: quite special
[4:11 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: did they seriously demote you because you invited william
[4:11 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: are they that fuckin' paranoid
[4:13 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: yknow what
[4:13 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I want in again
[4:26 PM] blimpy: no
[4:26 PM] blimpy: they didn't demote me
[4:26 PM] blimpy: dude
[4:26 PM] blimpy: wtf it was a joke
[4:26 PM] blimpy: i'm still mod
[4:26 PM] Jonathan Robertson: either way
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: if they TRULY want the drama to end
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: oh yeah don't mind the namechange
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: I'll change it back shortly
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: if they want to stop all the drama
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: A:
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: they ban the users involved
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: and B:
[4:27 PM] blimpy: i don't know why this is still a thing
[4:27 PM] Jonathan Robertson: they just detach themselves from us completely
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: well you're mod
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: THAT'S YOUR FUCKIN' JOB.
[4:28 PM] blimpy: ??? i can't control what other people do
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: you can ban...
[4:28 PM] blimpy: who the fuck do i ban?
[4:28 PM] blimpy: william?
[4:28 PM] blimpy: william's fine
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: nerd73
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: william341
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: and V-
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: they're the ones accentuating the drama
[4:28 PM] Jonathan Robertson: you want it to end you cut the fucking parasite out of the host(edited)
[4:29 PM] blimpy: no...they weren't talking about any of this
[4:29 PM] blimpy: until some guy messaged V- claiming to be an "anti shifter"
[4:29 PM] blimpy: obviously thinking the drama was still going on
[4:29 PM] blimpy: then that guy got confused up with william who also asked to be invited
[4:29 PM] blimpy: and then i was like "okay show's over kids"
[4:30 PM] Jonathan Robertson: actually
[4:30 PM] Jonathan Robertson: you know what
[4:30 PM] Jonathan Robertson: you have authority over V- and nerd
[4:30 PM] Jonathan Robertson: they obviously feed off this drama
[4:31 PM] Jonathan Robertson: use your authority to get through to them and explain them every fucking reason why what they do is wrong
[4:31 PM] blimpy: except they haven't been
[4:31 PM] Jonathan Robertson: make them piss themselves
[4:31 PM] blimpy: 99% of the time i talk to V- it's not about this
[4:31 PM] Jonathan Robertson: and what about nerd
[4:31 PM] blimpy: nerd's barely on
[4:32 PM] blimpy: the "demote blimpy" thing was a joke
[4:33 PM] blimpy: and everybody's fine with william.
[4:33 PM] blimpy: V- and I had a whole conversation one night about thinkpad thinklights.
[4:34 PM] blimpy: the "drama" was a one-off and now it's over.
[4:34 PM] Jonathan Robertson: then why does everyone constantly think it's still fucking happening
[4:34 PM] blimpy: it's just there was a small spark of it again when some guy messaged V- claiming to be an "anti-shifter", he thought it was ridiculous and sent the guy to raytron
[4:34 PM] Jonathan Robertson: either you're lying to me or they are
[4:35 PM] blimpy: then i went to raytron
[4:35 PM] blimpy: mistakingly thinking william was the supposed "anti shifter" because he messaged me earlier about getting into trip as well.
[4:36 PM] blimpy: i invited him because i knew the drama was over and there was no weird plan scheming
[4:36 PM] blimpy: although
[4:37 PM] blimpy: now that there's this weird new consensus that the drama is back on again
[4:38 PM] blimpy: i'm afraid people are gonna start throwing shit at each other
[4:38 PM] blimpy: when that happens, i will have my ban hammer ready
[4:39 PM] blimpy: honestly
[4:39 PM] blimpy: i'm starting to think it's you that's holding up the drama
[4:40 PM] blimpy: it seems that any interaction between anyone on both AF/SOS and trip is some kind of drama revival
[4:40 PM] blimpy: except, it isn't
[4:40 PM] blimpy: and before you logged on it would have been pretty harmonious
[4:40 PM] blimpy: i can give you the full logfile if you want.
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: I don't want fucking logd.
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: I want this all to end
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: and as said on SOS
[4:41 PM] blimpy: it did
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: if I get any logs or shit that even tries to prove the drama is still on
[4:41 PM] blimpy: go home and don't log on and tell everybody to ban everybody
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: from ANYONE
[4:41 PM] blimpy: william leaking logs to you is not my responsibility
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: I will do all the digging I want
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: I will make SURE that it is over
[4:41 PM] blimpy: tell him to shut up and stop leaking logs to you
[4:41 PM] Jonathan Robertson: and if I find any private witchhunting servers
[4:42 PM] Jonathan Robertson: ...you don't wanna know what I'll do.
[4:42 PM] blimpy: there's no private witchhunting servers wtf man
[4:42 PM] blimpy: why does everything have to be a conspiracy
[4:43 PM] blimpy: will sending logs is not my responsibility, i can't control what he's sending to you and he's being pretty courteous on trip
[4:43 PM] blimpy: tell him to stfu and the drama's over
[4:44 PM] blimpy: aaaand while i was talking to you
[4:44 PM] blimpy: a whole bunch of shit happened and william was zlined
