<strong>Is my SSD dead?</strong> - <a href="https://talk.raytron.org/User-Mamidre">Mamidre</a> -  <strong>09-13-2015</strong>
<br />
<br />
Last Wednesday, I went out and got myself a 240GB SanDisk SSD Plus Solid State Drive and installed Windows 10 on it. It ran pretty well for the past few days as I installed Firefox, an anti-virus (avast!), and Office 2013. But when I turned on my PC with the SSD, I found myself with the 'Operating system not found' error. No matter how many times I reconnect the drive to the SATA port, it posts the same error. So, a dead SSD or maybe something that I can do to revive my &#36;150 SSD? Remember that this SSD is less than a week old.

Maybe something went wrong inside the SSD. Get a refund and buy a 250GB Crucial BX100.

I'm guessing you just got a defective SSD. If you want to test it to make sure, you could try burning a copy of Hiren's BootCD and using one of the utilities on it to check the SSD just to make sure the drives bad. <br />
<br />
Now, because you just got this last week, what I would try to do is go back to the place you bought this off of and see if they will refund you. They'll probably give you the choice of either exchanging your SSD with another one or giving your money back outright (really depends on the business though).<br />
<br />
What I would do is just take the refund (if the place you bought it from even gives you one) and go for a Crucial or Samsung SSD as they are both pretty reliable SSD brands (nothing wrong with SanDisk though, I've just never had great luck with their products). <br />
<br />
If you can't for some reason get a refund through the place you bought it for whatever reason, contact SanDisk and have it fixed though your drives warranty. They will probably send you a refurb unit, though it might take you a little bit to get it if they make you wait until they receive the defective SSD before they ship your replacement. Save going though that hassle as a last resort though.

Pretty much what sir said, just more detailed.

As psychobat said, if you didn't do anything to it (Opening it up etc) they should honor your warranty and take back the SSD, and then replace it or fix it. My guess is you just got a defective unit. I've personally never used an ssd before (but I plan on putting one in my desktop for the boot drive), but I have used sandisk products in the past, and they're okay, but certainly not the best. I would recommend crucial or samsung ssds, as they're reliable and cheap.

I bought myself a USB 3.0 enclosure and the SSD works. Weird that my netbook can't detect my SSD even though it is SATA.
