An option that was proposed in the IRC was actually going back to OSFirstTimer, and maybe having him put the forum's URL in the description of videos. I think this might actually work, but it probably won't get us the users that we want.<br />
<br />
Then again, phillips1012 signed up during OSFT and he's certainly not 9 years old.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Clarifying that "going back to OSFirstTimer" does not mean actually changing this forum back to OSFirstTimer Forums, but simply contacting OSFirstTimer and making a deal with him.

Are you what? Do you seriously want to confuse 7-year-old children and have them flood our forums with low-quality posts? I'm sure this was why the RSP rule was enabled. Also, no filler text.<br />
<br />
For fuck's sake, I thought we were done with OSFT forever...

As much as I like OSFT and all, what fucking makes you think this'll help us? I mean, You get idiots like me when you try that. Besides, even if you DO decide to do this, good luck contacting him because I bet ya he's just fully out of the loop, and busy with work. He hasn't contacted me through Skype in a very long time, and our chats are rare and long, just sayin'.

My point exactly. Remember MrDzny? Not to be classified as an idiot... I mean he left a good comment about OSFT in his intro thread, but he got on here because he saw that OSFT had moved here! Yet we do not even share relations with Philip Adams anymore. <br />
<br />
Well, it could have been |'s responsibility to indicate on OSFT that techtalk.ga is not affiliated with OSFirstTimer... on the OSFT forums.<br />

Let's just not seriously. We don't need to grow the community. Phillip is perfectly right. Also doing something where osfirsttimer links to it in his youtube channel won't help in the slightest. We'll just get wrecked by an army of matty clones (aka 9 year olds).<br />
<br />
The community is fine as it is, and I have to agree with phillip. No offense vortex, but why do you keep insisting we grow it. We have no need or desire to. Most members are already not for it, and phillip technically has more power than you because he is the sysadmin... He could go as far as to just destroy this site altogether if he wanted. (Which at this point, really, wouldn't be super surprising either.)<br />
<br />
I really think it would harm us far more than help us, especially if we linked it in a channel like osfirsttimers.<br />
<br />
Also if you want to grow to "even out the amount of little kids and disabled people" that's just pathetic, and you should just leave if you don't like dealing with little kids or disabled people (Which pretty much everyone here is either young, has a disability or is both young and disabled.)

I really don't have too much of a problem with the idea of forum promotion, but I am not sure it's worth it. We would first have to find somewhere to promote the forum other than OSFT because asking him to promote tT would just be asking for trobule.<br />
<br />
After we figure out where we are going to promote this forum (if we do), then we would have to deal with the spam caused by little kids/people with no life deciding to join. Most the future members that will end up joining will probably will go inactive after a couple of days or they will just try to spam the forum because their life sucks and they have nothing better to do. That in turn would add to the workload of the staff and depending on how long the spam posts stay on the forum before they are noticed, it might turn away a potential good future member.<br />
<br />
We could start something like a probationary usergroup for all new members that makes it so the new members need to have their first 5-10 posts approved by the forum staff, which would at least hide the spam posts from the public, but we probably wouldn't get too many good future members from it in the end.

I have to agree with KK's and psychobat's ideas. <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">MOST</span> 9 year olds have a poor intellect. Promoting tT on OSFT would be a VERY bad idea as it would cause a rampage of little children asking "WHERE IZ OS 1ST TIMER????!!!11" as an example. We already have the OSTalk/OSFirstTimer forum archives already so why bother promoting?<br />
<blockquote class="mycode_quote"><cite>Quote:</cite>[...] dealing with little kids or disabled people (Which pretty much everyone here is either young, has a disability or is both young and disabled.)</blockquote>
<br />
THIS! I am in fact young (14) and disabled (Quadriplegia Cerebral Palsy), but my mind is NOT (I repeat, NOT) the equivalent to people who are 7 year olds spamming "I LIEK OSFT! TELL ME WHERE HE IS OR ELS ILL DIE!!!111"

I second this. And I partially agree with KK on this (because of retarded immature users), but let's face it, we need new members. I was already planning on inviting my best friend on both the forums and IRC. He's 13 years old (going on 14), and he's way more mature than Matty and Picky1004 combined.<br />
<br />
We just have to be careful with picking new members. I have a good faith belief that my friend will be a good fit for the forums.

I just don't see why we don't stay as a small community like we already are. I mean, everyone knows eachother, and we all know each other's interests, and we KNOW each other's maturity pretty well and there's typically not gonna be a lot of retarded little immature babies spamming "DEEZ NUTS 21 OSFT HA GOTEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111111111" in the chat, so there's that...
