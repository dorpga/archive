<div class="message">Well, lets see...<br />
<br />
I am 16 years old<br />
I am 5'8" and weigh 185lbs<br />
I got my license a couple weeks ago<br />
I recently got a summer job at a water park (minimum wage but free admission on off days)<br />
I generally like being outdoors in the summer and enjoy pools/bodies of water<br />
I hate California for some reason and never want to step foot in the state<br />
I have been to Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, and parts of Quebec<br />
Don't really play sports, though I will play rounds of basketball, baseball, dodgeball, or soccer if asked<br />
I plan on saving for a phone and a car this summer<br />
Only computer game I play regularly is Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory<br />

Lol, come to NH. We have a lot of communities with elementary schools that go to 8th grade and don't have a middle school. You basically go from elemantary to high, no middle.</div>
