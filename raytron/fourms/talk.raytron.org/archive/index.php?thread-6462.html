<div class="message">Yesterday YouTube released YouTube Gaming, a gaming live streaming service that is supposed to compete with Twitch. <br />
<br />
I've been playing around with it, checking people out, watching streams, and it's pretty cool. It's definitely faster than Twitch and doesn't buffer as much (I didn't have buffering issues with Twitch, but I did have quality issues) It also has a large library of games that you can follow, more than I was expecting, actually. You can also watch videos by Gaming Youtubers that you can also watch on YouTube. The only thing I don't like is the layout. I like the Twitch app layout better. I find the YT Gaming layout a bit confusing, but I've been getting the hang of it.<br />
<br />
Final thoughts: will it be successful? I believe so, since quality of the stream is better and it was released by YouTube. However, there are still a bunch of Youtubers streaming on Twitch, so I think it will be a while until they switch over, if they ever do. I don't believe YouTube offers subscriptions like Twitch does, which could keep people from switching for now. But overall, not bad for a first try YouTube.</div>

<div class="message">I haven't tried it out yet, due to the app not yet being available here in the Netherlands. The website is, but I can't really try that since it works really bad on my iPad.</div>

Like phillips1012 said, twitch uses flash which is highly unstable and and even insecure in the modern day...<br />
<br />
Of course when it comes to features and that jazz yes twitch is better, but they should move over to HTML5...</div>

phillips1012 said that argument is totally invalid. He thinks that you should die. Your opinion is WRONG! You really should just listen to phillips1012, everything he says is right.</div>

<div class="message">well anyways, the reason I say twitch is better because that's where the community is at.<br />
You guys know the youtube comment section, and that's the same community that will be watching streams on youtube gaming. 95% of well known streamers are on twitch, because twitch has been the leading platform for this stuff for years.</div>

While I will agree that Twitch has a great community, Twitch mainly sucks because it uses Flash for streams, which is highly unstable. Not only that, but watching Twitch on mobile is simply a pain in the ass, which caused me to leave it because I just couldn't stand the bullshit anymore.<br />
<br />
It's like you don't get what you came for... to peacefully watch a Battlefield 4 stream with little issues... YouTube does the livestream shit much better, even on mobile, and I'll stick to it.<br />
<br />
I'm also close to deactivating my Twitch account because I barely even use it anymore...<br />

HTML5 master race. It's 2015. Come on.</div>
