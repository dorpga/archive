			<div class="content">Well, I thought I would give an explanation of why I did what I did back on the former osft forum. Before I get into the details, I will do a basic intro. I am psychobat, most people call me psycho or physco due to my old username, physcobat (corrected the spelling for the current username). I was a mod of the dovernus forums before it was taken down and I was a former mod and former admod of the former osft forums. The people on this forum who havent officially met me yet or only saw me briefly might of heard of me through all the mention of my name on this forum via rumors and everyday chat, but most of you should remember me. I usually spend my time either on the computer or fixing various things around the house. My mom recently got a new car to replace the shitty chevy cavalier we used to have, so me and my mom have been taking more road trips to the beach or to a campground or places like that since we now have enough room so that we dont have to sacrifice comfort to fit everything in the car. Well, I think thats enough about me for the moment.<br /><br />Now, it is time to get onto my point of view of what happened. Right around the time osft gave up on the former osft forums and gave it to vortex, I decided I wasnt going to hold in my opinions any longer. I wont lie, from the beginning, I was siding with bribob, but I held in those opinions because I wanted to keep my position on the forums team. I got tired of the former osft forum getting spammed non stop, so I decided to act on my beliefs. I perdicted that I would get demoted and/or banned for acting on them, but I predicted it would push the community in the right direction. My actions were never meant for harm, even though there were times I will admit I was a bit harsh. It started by bribob offering to make a replacement forum for the former osft forum. I didnt see a problem with it and me, bribob, and uber somewhat teamed up and made the former dovernus forums. It took us about 4-7 days to finish and it was a hit at first. A day or two before it was finished, I unbanned cirno and bribob from the former osft forums because there was no proof to back there banned and I was pissed that they got banned. Before I go further into this, I am going to quote the one temporary rule because the thing it says about me isnt all that true from my standpoint:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Moderators and admins of the dovernus forums will be banned and IP banned. Sorry if this seems unfair, but we do not want anything to do with that community as they have harrassed users and moderators of our community and attempted to take over OSFT forums/OSTalk (psychobat tried to advertise dovernus forums in the announcements section of OSTalk and was demoted and banned for doing this)</div></blockquote><br /><br />First off, dovernus never tried to &quot;steal&quot; members from the osft forums, the goal of dovernus was to give members a second option for the ones either fed up with how the forum was ran or the ones who were sick of freeforums, it was never meant for harm. Also, I was not demoted and I sure as hell wasnt banned for promoting the dovernus forums in the announcements, I was demoted about a week or two after I promoted it and I was stuck in the unwelcome members section a 3-7 days after my demotion. My advertizement deemed dovernus as the unofficial replacement because I knew not everyone liked bribob and it wasnt an osft forum. Of course, I probably should of put it in the off topic section, but I thought as long as I put it as the unofficial replacement that not too many would mind if I stuck it in the announcements and tons of members advertized their forum on the osft forum with no punishments. Getting back on track so I dont make this miserably long and boring...........<br /><br />The dovernus forums opened up and I advertized it as I stated above. As a result, I got my account deactivated since for some reason, osft thought my account was hacked. I cleared it up with him and proved I wasnt hacked and i got it reactivated. At that point, he recently given up on the forum and gave it to vortex.At first, everything seemed okay, but it turned into a case that you were either on dovernus or you were on the former ostalk with no middle ground. Now, I predicted what was going to happen. The rise of dovernus was either going to replace the forum and the members from the former ostalk who didnt trust it would go somewhere else and ostalk would mostly crumble or everyone from ostalk was going to find a way to get off of freeforums without dovernus. Either way, I knew that osfirsttimer.freeforums.org would die and be replaced, which was mostly my goal to see that forum die so the community there wouldnt have to suffer with freeforums any longer. Once ostalk died and tech talk was born, dovernus died shortly after that. That is most of the way I see things, I apologize if I said some harsh things before and did some minimal spamming, it had to be done. If I left anything out or anyone has questions, feel free to email me at <!-- e --><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6c1e050f040d1e08030f0d1e1e0300005b2c0b010d0500420f0301"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="81f3e8e2e9e0f3e5eee2e0f3f3eeededb6c1e6ece0e8edafe2eeec">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a><!-- e --> or if it is possible, I would like it if my ban would be delayed for a couple days, if it can, then just reply to this and I will answer questions on this thread, but if I am going to get banned right away like I think I am, just email me your questions and I will answer it as soon as I can.<br /><br />Now, I wont lie, I do not regret at all what I did and I wouldnt do things differently if I could go back in time. I believe that if I didnt rebel, we would still be on freeforums and freeforums is hell in my opinion and possibly many others opinions and I believed that this community needed a push to get away from freeforums. A lot of my actions were to help this forum and not hurt this forum, even though there were points in time I got too carried away with it. <br /><br />Now, the reason why I didnt sign up with the name psychobat was because I knew I would be banned before I would finish typing this and I do not want to have to break the ban evasion rule to post this. I will not show my face on this forum ever again if that's what everyone wants, which I assume that's what everyone wants. I would however like everyone to consider giving me a second chance by letting me be a regular member. If I can get a second chance, I will be keeping this account and I would not make a second account to get my old username back, even though I would like it if I could get a username change. I will again deeply apologize to anyone I said harsh things to or offended, but as I said tons before in this message, my intentions were to push this forum in the right direction so it wouldnt die at freeforums. I am about ready to end this thread as for it has gone on far too long, I hope everybody reads this fully, forgives the harsh things I said, and considers giving me a second chance.<br /><br />P.S. You can also contact me via skype. My skype name is physcobat.</div>

			<div class="content">Nuh uh, I'm not giving you a second chance. Like I am with everyone, I'm gonna be <span style="font-weight: bold">BLUNT</span>.<br />Truth is; I never really liked you. You were self-centered on OSTalk, and when you became moderator there, you were acting as an administrator or something, saying we should do this and that, that's when most of us hated you. You are trying to make us believe after you threatening users that you will give them so many warnings and bans, that they will regret it, that we should forgive you? Yes, you tried to apologize, but I still hold a grudge. And here is what's new:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">After Dovernus died:</span><br />Dover crawled back here<br />Uber crawled back<br />and YOU<br /><br />You were also on dover's side when we were getting attacked by Malwareup. You said that he was a good guy, when he bothered everyone else. And BTW, dover was trying to steal our members, he even said he wanted everyone to go to his forum were it's &quot;Better&quot;. And you made the announcement to switch there to get away from the spam-ball, OSTalk when it was clear we are already in the first stage of TechTalk. And, I'm glad that Dovernus died off, Disrespectful staff, and dover was hiding the powers from the new people he put as Mods and Admins. It went to the point where Jacob Rowles went crazy on dover. So what I'm saying is, that I don't forgive you, I won't give you a second chance. In my eyes, I saw that you were making the OSTalk community shutdown, crumble and move to where you wanted to go. We had plans, but as a &quot;Good Moderator&quot;, You thought that you had all power. Now, I'm usally not this rude to anyone, I hate you.<br /><br />P.S. You came with dover and spammed IRC chat, remember that?</div>

Also, I was not demoted and I sure as hell wasnt banned for promoting the dovernus forums in the announcements, I was demoted about a week or two after I promoted it and I was stuck in the unwelcome members section a 3-7 days after my demotion. My advertizement deemed dovernus as the unofficial replacement because I knew not everyone liked bribob and it wasnt an osft forum. Of course, I probably should of put it in the off topic section, but I thought as long as I put it as the unofficial replacement that not too many would mind if I stuck it in the announcements and tons of members advertized their forum on the osft forum with no punishments. Getting back on track so I dont make this miserably long and boring...........<br /><br />The dovernus forums opened up and I advertized it as I stated above. As a result, I got my account deactivated since for some reason, osft thought my account was hacked. I cleared it up with him and proved I wasnt hacked and i got it reactivated. At that point, he recently given up on the forum and gave it to vortex.At first, everything seemed okay, but it turned into a case that you were either on dovernus or you were on the former ostalk with no middle ground. Now, I predicted what was going to happen. The rise of dovernus was either going to replace the forum and the members from the former ostalk who didnt trust it would go somewhere else and ostalk would mostly crumble or everyone from ostalk was going to find a way to get off of freeforums without dovernus. Either way, I knew that osfirsttimer.freeforums.org would die and be replaced, which was mostly my goal to see that forum die so the community there wouldnt have to suffer with freeforums any longer. Once ostalk died and tech talk was born, dovernus died shortly after that. That is most of the way I see things, I apologize if I said some harsh things before and did some minimal spamming, it had to be done. If I left anything out or anyone has questions, feel free to email me at <!-- e --><a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#582a313b30392a3c373b392a2a3734346f183f35393134763b3735"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0c7e656f646d7e68636f6d7e7e6360603b4c6b616d6560226f6361">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */</script></a><!-- e --> or if it is possible, I would like it if my ban would be delayed for a couple days, if it can, then just reply to this and I will answer questions on this thread, but if I am going to get banned right away like I think I am, just email me your questions and I will answer it as soon as I can.<br /><br />Now, I wont lie, I do not regret at all what I did and I wouldnt do things differently if I could go back in time. I believe that if I didnt rebel, we would still be on freeforums and freeforums is hell in my opinion and possibly many others opinions and I believed that this community needed a push to get away from freeforums. A lot of my actions were to help this forum and not hurt this forum, even though there were points in time I got too carried away with it. <br /><br />Now, the reason why I didnt sign up with the name psychobat was because I knew I would be banned before I would finish typing this and I do not want to have to break the ban evasion rule to post this. I will not show my face on this forum ever again if that's what everyone wants, which I assume that's what everyone wants. I would however like everyone to consider giving me a second chance by letting me be a regular member. If I can get a second chance, I will be keeping this account and I would not make a second account to get my old username back, even though I would like it if I could get a username change. I will again deeply apologize to anyone I said harsh things to or offended, but as I said tons before in this message, my intentions were to push this forum in the right direction so it wouldnt die at freeforums. I am about ready to end this thread as for it has gone on far too long, I hope everybody reads this fully, forgives the harsh things I said, and considers giving me a second chance.<br /><br />P.S. You can also contact me via skype. My skype name is physcobat.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Believe it or not, I forgive you after you did things to me that are worth discussing.</div>

Like I am with everyone, I'm gonna be <span style="font-weight: bold">BLUNT</span>.<br />Truth is; I never really liked you. You were self-centered on OSTalk, and when you became moderator there, you were acting as an administrator or something, saying we should do this and that, that's when most of us hated you. You are trying to make us believe after you threatening users that you will give them so many warnings and bans, that they will regret it. Yes, you tried to apologise, but I still hold a grudge. And here is what's new:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">After Dovernus died:</span><br />Dover crawled back here<br />Uber crawled back<br />and YOU<br /><br />You were also on dover's side when we were getting attacked by Malwareup. You said that he was a good guy, when he bothered everyone else. And BTW, dover was trying to steal our members, he even said he wanted everyone to go to his forum were it's &quot;Better&quot;. And you made the announcement to switch there to get away from the spam-ball, OSTalk when it was clear we are already in the first stage of TechTalk. And, I'm glad that Dovernus died off, Disrespectful staff, and dover was hiding the powers from the new people he put as Mods and Admins. It went to the point where Jacob Rowles went crazy on dover. So what I'm saying is, that I don't forgive you, I won't give you a second chance. In my eyes, I saw that you were making the OSTalk community shutdown, crumble and move to where you wanted to go. We had plans, but as a &quot;Good Moderator&quot;, You thought that you had all power. Now, I'm usally not this rude to anyone, I hate you.<br /><br />P.S. You came with dover and spammed IRC chat, remember that?</div></blockquote><br /><br />I dont blame you at all for your assumptions. If it counts, I already knew you hated me just like I know metro hates me and a few others I cant remember. I also wont lie about I was corrupt when I was a mod on the former osft forums. I wouldnt call myself self centered, but I would definetly say I was corrupt because I knew how to make any election work in my favor. A good example was the April 2014 elections, snorks should of never won, Linucks was the true winner except I pulled every string I could to get as many votes for snorks as i possibly could. There were many more elections and things that were rigged. I defended bribob because I thought he would be good for the forum, my opinion was that if bribob stayed, he would weed out some of the annoying members with his personality. Also, when I posted the announcement promoting dovernus, techtalk wasnt in its first stage. When I promoted dovernus, this community was beginning to actually consider moving and I wanted to see this forum move from freeforums faster. Of course, most of my ideas arent all that good to begin with. Also, what bribob was doing on dovernus was weeding out the &quot;annoying nine year olds&quot; by annoying them to the point they either leave the forum or they give him a reason to ban them, his method was actually quite effective. I realize I wont get forgiveness from all, even though I would like forgiveness. I fully knew what I was getting into when I started siding with bribob left and right and I am willing to face the music.Also, I never did go too far when I became a mod there, I only started going extreme when I got tired of the spam attacks and mostly cracked.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>MetroHaterx54x2 wrote:</cite>Believe it or not, I forgive you after you did things to me that are worth discussing.</div></blockquote><br /><br />Happy to know at least one person forgives me. Feel free to discuss the things I did to you that are worth discussing, half of this topic is for explaining my actions and I would be happy to explain why I did everything I did from day 1.</div>

			<div class="content">I honestly think we need to keep an eye on Psycho for the time being. Psycho clearly doesn't show his dedication to our forum enough considering he attacked people and spammed the old IRC. I just don't trust people who do a complete 180 on their beliefs as the old forums had nothing to do with Dover nor was Dover welcomed by most users simply because of how he treated other users.<br /><br />I honestly did not want to be a part of Dover's forums for the main reason that it was essentially something you would see the KKK host.</div>

        <div style="display: none;">If your son has requested a new &quot;processor&quot; from a company called &quot;Intel&quot;, this is genuine cause for alarm.

They use child labor  extensively in their third world sweatshops, and they deliberately disable the security features that American processor makers, such as AMD, use to prevent hacking. Intel chips are never sold in stores, and you will most likely be told  that you have to order them from internet sites. Do not buy this chip!
