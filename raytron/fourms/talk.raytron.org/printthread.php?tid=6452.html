<strong>A little project I'm working on...</strong> - <a href="https://talk.raytron.org/User-Michael">Michael</a> -  <strong>08-12-2015</strong>
<br />
<br />
Hey everyone! It's Michael, admin of the ShiftOS-Next forums. Wait... Hold on... ShiftOS-Next forums are not going to be all about ShiftOS-Next... but... what I'm going to show you is gonna make you happy, considering I'm usually a huge script-kiddie.<br />
<br />
If you've been chatting with me and a few others over on Skype, namely Whistler and TheRandomMelon, you've probably heard about The Shifted Dimension. And, since some of you guys aren't really on these skype groups, and I don't go on IRC often, I thought I'd tell you about this project.<br />
<br />
Now, I have no idea if this counts as advertising, or if there's even a rule against it, but if there is and this is considered advertising, I apologize.<br />
<br />
So, if you've been on the ShiftOS forums back when it was killed off (around June 1st, 2015) you'd know Rhobariii leaked the original story since it'd really have no use anymore. I read it. Right to the end. The end, though, didn't really fit in a ShiftOS-like game, so I said "What if I could take this crappy ending to a game like ShiftOS, and elaborate on it, and then put it to use in a game that it'd fit in?"<br />
<br />
If you haven't seen ShiftOS's story, I'll link the google doc. Just be sure to read it all if you wanna find the bits I'm talking about... hint... it's where DevX starts revealing that ShiftOS isn't an experimental OS, but an experiment. Just read on from there. &lt;!-- m --&gt;&lt;a class="postlink" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eve0O3R4tViSSrrZWh7RYQ96QyqxU8-S3OIbS7tmE9E/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eve ... sp=sharing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- m --&gt;<br />
<br />
So, here's what I'm doing. I downloaded the Unreal Engine a few months ago, to create the game. The game is a third-person, single player open world set in the city of New Bluecoast, starring Michael Rivard as the protagonist. He works for a scientific company called EARTH. His job: Be a badass, program experimental software and hardware, and steal things. His past few missions were pretty sucky as they involved him stopping cyber-criminal AIs like DevX from spreading viruses and software like ShiftOS and taking over the world. But, his newest mission's pretty amazing. Him and EARTH will work to create the next big thing in technology. Better than VR, Better than augmented reality, Wiping the floor with any PS4, 64GB RAM gaming PC, or Xbox One. What is this amazing thing? Well, EARTH wants to call it the Shifted Dimension. A universe ran and operated completely by one computer, and it can be programmed, explored, and can be entered by any life form in the real universe knowing of it's existence. Of course, with this system being the first of it's kind, there's no golden book to programming such a thing, and there's no machinery capable. But, EARTH is scientific. They can handle inventing the machinery and programming. All Michael has to do is follow their orders, stealing machinery from various New Bluecoast companies, meeting friends and enemies along the way, and looking like a badass doing so. Once the Shifted Dimension is built, Michael is the test subject. He must go into the Shifted Dimension and program even more stuff for it... but he soon discovers that EARTH isn't what he thought they were. I mean, how would you explain them creating self-replicating software, essentially creating ShiftOS, the most controversial virus ever, responsible for causing trillions of dollars in damage just from hard drive formats? How would you explain them telling Michael to steal from billion dollar companies just to build a universe of a large scale? Michael finds out the truth about EARTH, and they know it. Now it's time for Michael to get his revenge, and destroy EARTH once and for all, gaining complete control of the Shifted Dimension in the process.<br />
<br />
So, yeah... just a little bit of info about a project I'm making. Of course, this ain't no VB script-kiddie bullcrap, so it's going to be INCREDIBLY tough to create on my own. If anyone's interested in helping out, let me know. I'm not putting any money into this, as I'm distributing the game for free. Anything will help. Music, story, 3D models, textures, voices, sound effects, UE4 Blueprints, anything.

The ShiftOS-Next forums already turned into a hellhole, and previous attempts have failed. I do not expect happiness to come out of this.<br />

Nothing to note here, but I do want to say those are the two most annoying people in the group. Jeez.<br />

It should count as advertising, but I think the mods have really only been enforcing website promotions. Guess we'll find out.<br />

"The end, though, didn't really fit in a ShiftOS-like game." But, what does count as a ShiftOS-like game? There's no basis for it. That's just what <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">you</span> want the game to be. Reading the story, though, I'd have to say that the ending fit well, despite being a cliche.<br />
<br />

Not a bad choice. You can make beautiful games for (almost) free, without any limits that the free version of Unity. That being said, I'd still use Unity if I had a budget higher than what I have for my current game (&#36;0).<br />

Naming a character after yourself. I don't disagree with the decision, but you surely could've had more creativity than that. Also forced ShiftOS tie-in. <span style="font-size: 25pt;" class="mycode_size">the worst sin of story writing</span><br />

How did EARTH create this? Why did EARTH create this? Why did EARTH change their goal as a business? Don't you think a virtual universe would be abused easily? There's many plot holes here. But I'll give credit for an interesting idea <span style="text-decoration: line-through;" class="mycode_s">that's been done before, though there is more unoriginal ideas</span>.<br />

First, I'm going to say this:<br />
 "and looking like a badass doing so"<br />
The egotism, it burns!<br />
Secondly, why is Michael, someone who does completely different jobs, doing this job? And I'm going to have to go back to my other point: why is EARTH doing this in the first place?<br />
<br />

I think instead of 'how,' it's more of a question of 'why.'<br />

What exactly did EARTH do? It's not really explained in the wall of text you made.<br />
<br />

Indie devs do it all the time, but considering your experience, you could use the help.<br />
<br />
Overall, could use work. I'm not a critic, so I probably missed a ton. I'll be willing to make some stuff for it if you don't mind.

First off, the reason there are plot holes is because you're looking at the summary. I'm not giving you a novel of the story. That'd just ruin the game.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I suck at picking names for characters. Honestly, I dislike Michael Rivard as a name, but it's all I could think of while trying to keep any name containing "Ladouceur" out of the picture.

I don't know why but the name "Thomas" instantly sprung to my head. That's a similarly "male" name.

Sorry to break it for you, but making such a game requires years of practice, at least minimum 3d modeling skills, a team and most importantly funding. You have none of these. You can't just download Unreal and say "i will make a game alone entirely with freely available models". The reason why people consider you a script kiddie is because you're starting projects too big for you to handle. VB has nothing to do with everything. Users here don't like it mostly because its not cross compatible with Linux. If you want to be a good programmer work on small projects to polish your skills. And please do not throw me sob-stories.

This game is probably not some sort of magnum opus. From what I can gather Michael is making this game <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">to</span> learn.<br />
<br />
I don't know why you're such an enemy to Michael, V0rTeX. Like whenever he says anything you write a paragraph on how you hate him. Not defending Michael, i'm just saying WTF

<br />
<br />
Yes. I've said countless amounts of time, in countless chats, heck, even the UE4 forums, that I'm NOT MAKING a GTA V-level game, or anything considered even a AA game. It's for me to learn, and to experiment. Heck, the open-world part is fucking easy. Switch on World Composition in a blank level, then put each tile of the world in a separate level, then World Composition'll load 'em up for you, then you can arrange the tiles to form a world map which can be edited from within the persistent level. Bam, you made an Open World. Now, all you need to do is add RPG elements, some missions, and a playable character pawn. The character pawn's easy, because when creating a project, you could easily choose between many templates, whether it be 2D, 3D, First Person, Third Person, Driving, lots. <br />
<br />
As for high-quality trees and grass, just use the Kite Demo package. It's only 6.3 GB and will really speed up the process of creating forests and scenic areas, that is if you can craft the Blueprints necessary to handle the procedural generation, which shouldn't be difficult. Hop in the Experimental section of the Engine Preferences and you'll find some tools that'll do this for you. Fun fact: These tools were used at either GDC 2014 or GDC 2015 (if that happened, if it hasn't yet than it was 2014) to show off Open World development in UE4? Yeah. There's a reason they're in the experimental section.<br />
<br />
For the city, hop in Blender, or your favorite modelling software, and stop being lazy and practice modelling and texturing until you've made a few houses, shops, skyscrapers, offices, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;" class="mycode_s">nuke plants</span> factories. etc, and a few street props like lamps, benches, etc, and some road segments. Then, piece 'em up all together in the UE4 world, and bam. Open world with a playable character and a city done.<br />
<br />
Now let's add some missions and cutscenes. Go experiment with Blueprints and Matinee, until you've made something cool. Be sure to watch some of the UE4 tutorials by people like Tesla Dev, and even Epic Games themselves.<br />
<br />
All done? Great, you made an RPG. Now you can play around with more Blueprint and see if you can add driveable cars like in GTA.<br />
<br />
GTA-like game checklist:<br />
 - Open world: CHECK!<br />
 - Third person or first person character: CHECK!<br />
 - Scenic areas (mountains, forests, etc): CHECK!<br />
 - Driveable cars: CHECK!<br />
 - RPG-like non-linear misssions: CHECK!<br />
<br />
There, you've successfully made a ghetto GTA III with next-gen graphics. Add a second dimension and a few super powers and some more missions and the ability to program it, and you have a ghetto Shifted Dimension.<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you need a headstart on modelling the city, there are various sites giving away free models like streetlamps and bridges. You'll just have to look around for models that are either in .fbx or models that can safely be imported into Blender than exported into .fbx files. Oh, and Blender's scaling units are in centimeters, and UE4's are in meters, so when exporting your model, set the Scale to x100 before exporting so your model shows up the right size in UE4, otherwise your character will be Godzilla and can move around and destroy your city just by walking forward. Not a bad game, but we're not going for that.
