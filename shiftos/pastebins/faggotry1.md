[6:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: dude
[6:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I've got my own spies on their servers
[6:27 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: leaching info
[6:27 PM] blimpy: lol but the tertiary server you haven't got
[6:28 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: to a place that not even the mods can access
[6:28 PM] blimpy: and i'm not gonna give it to you, AI is dead
[6:28 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: only me, Rylan, Victor and Phil
[6:28 PM] blimpy: AI is dead
[6:28 PM] blimpy: does anybody even go on AI?
[6:28 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: we're on the other server too
[6:28 PM] blimpy: i'm not on there any more, what happens
[6:28 PM] blimpy: what name the server
[6:28 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and we've gotten fairly recent logs from AI
[6:29 PM] blimpy: name the new server
[6:29 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I forget it, I'll have to go back in logs
[6:29 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: triplicate-something IIRC
[6:29 PM] blimpy: holy shit
[6:29 PM] blimpy: you're not lying
[6:29 PM] blimpy: who are your plants?
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm not disclosing that.
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm still not sure who's side you're on
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and having this info leaked
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: will fuck up
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: ALL
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the plans
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: all your plans
[6:30 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: all my plans
[6:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: everything
[6:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: will go to complete shit
[6:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and that's what I fear
[6:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: what keeps me up at night
[6:31 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I have to literally perform nightly thought rituals to get my mind to think about something completely unrelated to all of this
[6:32 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: so I don't get vivid nightmares of what could happen(edited)
[6:32 PM] blimpy: woah don't overthink it dude
[6:32 PM] blimpy: but no, i am not on their side
[6:32 PM] blimpy: i don't really know how to prove it
[6:32 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: but believe me, Jacob, I know EVERY SINGLE PLAN of theirs to do with us
[6:33 PM] blimpy: other than the fact that i have displayed annoyance and want it all to stop
[6:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: the only way you can prove it
[6:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: is that
[6:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: given that I have eyes everywhere
[6:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: if ANYONE
[6:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: mentions that you know this
[6:33 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: or that this is known
[6:33 PM] blimpy: [6:31 PM] nerd73: don't expose, [plant] ok?
[6:31 PM] blimpy: k
[6:32 PM] nerd73: also, please remove the "nerd73 may be planning shit" comment
[6:33 PM] blimpy: k
[6:33 PM] blimpy: lol he's pissed
[6:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: for now you're innocent till proven guilty
[6:34 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: you're on our side
[6:34 PM] blimpy: okay.
[6:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: but if I get logs of you leaking the info or someone mentioning that the info was leaked
[6:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: that's when you're proven guilty
[6:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: you're the ONLY person I've gone into detail about this with
[6:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: other than the plants I've got
[6:35 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: so ANY mention of this conversation is a DIRECT link to you
[6:35 PM] blimpy: okay, point taken
[6:36 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and hey... this whole drama... it's shaping up to be a good plot for the ShiftOS story lol
[6:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: so all those AI and triplicate fuckers are doing is writing the ShiftOS story xD
[6:37 PM] blimpy: main reason i want to know about the plants is so i can leave this net for a while and still get info to and from "your side"
[6:37 PM] blimpy: since i have access to some secret channels on there as well
[6:37 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: well I mean
[6:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: if I told my plants that I told you any of this
[6:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: they'd get pissed at me
[6:38 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: so I REALLY don't want them finding out
[6:39 PM] blimpy: wait, why would they get pissed?
[6:39 PM] blimpy: if i'm on your side
[6:40 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I just told rylan, he seems to be okay
[6:41 PM] blimpy: hm
[6:42 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and here's the thing
[6:42 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I can prove that I knew who SuperOSFTFan was before he even had speak privileges
[6:42 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: https://images.discordapp.net/.eJwNyMsNwyAMANBdGADzKw7ZBhFEoiYYYUc5VN29fcf3Ufc81ap2kcErwHZwoblpFpq5Vd2I2lnzOFgXuiCL5LJftQuDW16LTQ5d8skbNCb9C4PFEJMLPjrrMcLd352erkdv6vsDCWoi6g.fWit0xu6yjU7CXLgXEPrcQo7dkA

[6:45 PM] blimpy: main reason i want to contact them is to grant them access to #fuck-shit-up
[6:45 PM] blimpy: which is where 99% of the autists hangout anyway
[6:45 PM] blimpy: http://i.imgur.com/8LHendN.png

[6:46 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: alright I just let the whole crew know you're on our side
[6:49 PM] blimpy: so...who's the crew? to give them access to FSU i kinda need to know their names(edited)
[6:49 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: Rylan, Victor Tran, me, Philip Adams.
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: yes, even Phil is a plant.
[6:50 PM] blimpy: yeah but they're not on the server
[6:50 PM] blimpy: except for phil
[6:50 PM] blimpy: unless they're under different names
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: oh Victor definitely is
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: he's using a different ID
[6:50 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: "Sade"
[6:51 PM] blimpy: ah
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: and Rylan is just on plan protection duties
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: making sure none of this gets out
[6:51 PM] blimpy: so wait which acct is yours then
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I'm not on there, I'm just overseeing the whole operation
[6:51 PM] blimpy: oh
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: I run the safehaven chats
[6:51 PM] Michael VanOverbeek: where the data gets dumped to
[6:52 PM] blimpy: fair enuf
