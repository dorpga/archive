Aug 16 14:11:30 <Jelle>	idk if he will remove it or not, but you can give it a try

Aug 16 14:12:36 <MichaelTheShifter>	Jelle, MINE TOO.
Aug 16 14:12:56 <mozzarella>	the thing is, you overreacted with your bots at the forum
Aug 16 14:13:07 <Jelle>	bots?
Aug 16 14:13:08 <mozzarella>	you should have reacted in a more private way
Aug 16 14:13:14 <MichaelTheShifter>	bots?

Aug 16 14:13:29 <MichaelTheShifter>	I don't even know how to set up a phpbb bot.

Aug 16 14:13:46 <mozzarella>	aka. that other admin guy

Aug 16 14:14:10 <V0rTeX>	like at all
Aug 16 14:14:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	not like I can take him off the admin team just because he fucked up on another site

Aug 16 14:40:51 <nerd73>	was roasting for entertainment purposes
Aug 16 14:40:55 <nerd73>	and is not to be taken seriously
Aug 16 14:41:14 <MichaelTheShifter>	nerd73, except when it could potentially affect me personally.
Aug 16 14:41:25 <Jelle>	i for once agree
Aug 16 14:41:36 <MichaelTheShifter>	and that's literally what it's doing
Aug 16 14:41:46 <nerd73>	I mean, maybe blimpy went too far
Aug 16 14:41:49 <MichaelTheShifter>	I could pretend and pretend to think it's funny and satirical
Aug 16 14:41:51 <Jelle>	i love satire, but it it seriously affects the 'victim' his personal life
Aug 16 14:41:53 <Jelle>	no.
Aug 16 14:42:06 <MichaelTheShifter>	but inside, it's destroying me.
Aug 16 14:42:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	I can't even sleep because of it.
Aug 16 14:43:00 <nerd73>	well
Aug 16 14:43:05 <nerd73>	if you're that affected by it

Aug 16 14:43:43 <V0rTeX>	less than 20
Aug 16 14:44:05 <V0rTeX>	not.. 40 million
Aug 16 14:45:08 *	elCaudillo (maelask@remove.autismo) has joined
Aug 16 14:45:15 <elCaudillo>	i'm bored
Aug 16 14:45:36 <nerd73>	because I think adding fuel to a big fire
Aug 16 14:45:40 <nerd73>	isn't the right thing to do
Aug 16 14:45:52 <Jelle>	damn right.
Aug 16 14:45:54 <nerd73>	and doing a dr. phil impression on michael would definitely add fuel to the fire
Aug 16 14:46:10 <elCaudillo>	what's dr. phil 
Aug 16 14:46:26 <Jelle>	>having never heard of dr. phil
Aug 16 14:46:55 <elCaudillo>	yea
Aug 16 14:46:57 <elCaudillo>	i haven't
Aug 16 14:47:15 <Jelle>	it's some 'murican tv show where two people fight some drama with dr. phil as psychologue trying to sort it out
Aug 16 14:48:29 <elCaudillo>	somebody should take obat there
Aug 16 14:51:57 <nerd73>	yeah
Aug 16 14:52:08 <nerd73>	but it's usually 2 people involved
Aug 16 14:52:19 <nerd73>	so I guess take any random other person of the rol staff
Aug 16 14:53:12 <Jelle>	nah, sloveniaweeb against hounsell, rez and elCaudillo
Aug 16 14:53:20 <Jelle>	that's gonna be fun
Aug 16 14:54:13 <Rakotondramanana>	lol
Aug 16 14:54:51 <elCaudillo>	please yes
Aug 16 14:55:55 <MichaelTheShifter>	V0rTeX, I know he's not pewdiepie, but think of it this way
Aug 16 14:56:03 <MichaelTheShifter>	leafy wasn't always as popular as he is.
Aug 16 14:56:07 <psychobat>	dr phil is the most boring man alive
Aug 16 14:56:23 <MichaelTheShifter>	blimpy makes one truly controversial video and I'm D O N E FUCKED.
Aug 16 14:57:05 <MichaelTheShifter>	and so is Jonny, ShiftOS, Memphis, my YouTube, my life and everything I live for
Aug 16 14:57:18 <MichaelTheShifter>	all because of my prepubescent fuccboi mistakes.
Aug 16 14:57:20 <elCaudillo>	at least he kinda obscured your name
Aug 16 14:57:39 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, except anyone can google shiftos and I appear on the first page
Aug 16 14:57:59 <MichaelTheShifter>	and I'm the only one who's touched shiftos with the eye disease he mentioned...
Aug 16 14:58:07 <elCaudillo>	https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoNbI1RyOMRyZye2_HLSy7w
Aug 16 14:58:13 <elCaudillo>	first page

Aug 16 14:58:37 <MichaelTheShifter>	wait wat
Aug 16 14:58:40 <Jelle>	he had a shiftOS channel
Aug 16 14:58:48 <MichaelTheShifter>	I thought he did the 'change your url' thing
Aug 16 14:58:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	still, not talking YT
Aug 16 14:59:01 <MichaelTheShifter>	my blog's on there
Aug 16 14:59:08 <MichaelTheShifter>	same as my github iirc
Aug 16 14:59:21 <Jelle>	https://youtu.be/xVFUyBG38Qo
Aug 16 14:59:27 <MichaelTheShifter>	and the original forums... I made a post on there in a forum that guests can see
Aug 16 14:59:27 <Jelle>	this is clearly osft
Aug 16 14:59:33 <MichaelTheShifter>	talking about the new shiftos
Aug 16 14:59:36 <MichaelTheShifter>	so it'll point to me.
Aug 16 15:00:00 <MichaelTheShifter>	and the wiki mentions me as lead dev as far as I remember
Aug 16 15:00:04 <MichaelTheShifter>	so THAT points to me
Aug 16 15:00:11 <MichaelTheShifter>	and anything that points to that points to me
Aug 16 15:00:26 <MichaelTheShifter>	and anything that points to anything that points to that points to me
Aug 16 15:00:51 <MichaelTheShifter>	until we've reached literally the exact opposite side of the web

Aug 16 15:01:55 <elCaudillo>	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPMDCJrRpT8
Aug 16 15:10:24 <MichaelTheShifter>	can you stop posting that damn video and put yourself in my shoes for a second
Aug 16 15:10:29 <MichaelTheShifter>	like seriously
Aug 16 15:10:36 <MichaelTheShifter>	I was born with a disease I cannot control AT ALL
Aug 16 15:10:52 <MichaelTheShifter>	and it causes me to see weird colors and shit when I'm tired - aka hallucinate
Aug 16 15:11:07 <MichaelTheShifter>	and someone is making a video, joking about this shit
Aug 16 15:11:21 <MichaelTheShifter>	and joking about shit I've regretted literally a day after doing
Aug 16 15:11:32 <MichaelTheShifter>	and have tried to forget about and move on from for months
Aug 16 15:11:49 <Rakotondramanana>	>ShiftOS
Aug 16 15:12:00 <MichaelTheShifter>	this isn't even about shiftos anymore
Aug 16 15:12:08 <MichaelTheShifter>	this is about me as a person
Aug 16 15:12:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	a HUMAN BEING.
Aug 16 15:12:25 <MichaelTheShifter>	with THOUGHTS and FEELINGS and a LIFE
Aug 16 15:12:29 <V0rTeX>	<MichaelTheShifter> and so is Jonny, ShiftOS, Memphis, my YouTube, my life and everything I live for
Aug 16 15:12:39 <V0rTeX>	no you live to graduate and find a job
Aug 16 15:12:50 <V0rTeX>	and then retire
Aug 16 15:12:57 <V0rTeX>	when you get old
Aug 16 15:13:11 <MichaelTheShifter>	V0rTeX, don't make me think about that
Aug 16 15:13:27 <MichaelTheShifter>	that causes an existential crisis, and this is not the time for that.
Aug 16 15:14:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	and think of it this way
Aug 16 15:14:28 <MichaelTheShifter>	it's not like a blind guy can get a job, idk, making subs at a subway
Aug 16 15:14:35 <MichaelTheShifter>	or stocking shelves at a grocery store
Aug 16 15:14:44 <MichaelTheShifter>	programming is all I've got.
Aug 16 15:15:01 <V0rTeX>	i though there's hope for your eyes
Aug 16 15:15:05 <MichaelTheShifter>	so even if we're not talking about that right now, it IS technically what I live for
Aug 16 15:15:24 <MichaelTheShifter>	V0rTeX, that's probably not gonna work or it'll be way too expensive.
Aug 16 15:15:38 <Jelle>	back
Aug 16 15:15:40 <MichaelTheShifter>	it has a chance of making them worse, you know.
Aug 16 15:16:29 <MichaelTheShifter>	it's like roulette. You could walk out with 20-20 visual acuity (regular human vision)
Aug 16 15:16:46 <MichaelTheShifter>	or you could end up not even being able to walk a straight line cuz all you see is black.
Aug 16 15:17:24 <MichaelTheShifter>	or you could end up still having RP
Aug 16 15:17:32 <MichaelTheShifter>	either at an accelerated or decelerated rate
Aug 16 15:17:52 <MichaelTheShifter>	accelerated meaning... the rods and cones die faster and you lose more vision over time
Aug 16 15:18:43 <MichaelTheShifter>	well, here I go again killing another fucking chatroom... ugh... why do I bother...
Aug 16 15:18:54 <nerd73>	well
Aug 16 15:19:19 <Jelle>	it's nor killing in any way
Aug 16 15:19:45 <V0rTeX>	you should stop thinking about your decease
Aug 16 15:20:00 <V0rTeX>	that way you will feel better
Aug 16 15:20:08 <MichaelTheShifter>	V0rTeX, I know your english isn't good sometimes but... decease...
Aug 16 15:20:12 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'm not dead! xD

Aug 16 15:20:27 <mozzarella>	anything going on?
Aug 16 15:20:31 <mozzarella>	still dramu?
Aug 16 15:20:52 <MichaelTheShifter>	also I wish it were that easy but when my disease affects something as fundamental as being able to see
Aug 16 15:21:06 <MichaelTheShifter>	that stuff sticks with you unconsciously.
Aug 16 15:21:11 <MichaelTheShifter>	your entire life.
Aug 16 15:21:44 <MichaelTheShifter>	even if I wanted to forget about it, it'll always be a giant aching thorn in my side
Aug 16 15:22:25 <MichaelTheShifter>	you really wouldn't understand unless you lived with it
Aug 16 15:22:45 <MichaelTheShifter>	and what pisses me off even more about the blimpy vid is that
Aug 16 15:22:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	I completely detached myself from this side of the community
Aug 16 15:23:10 <MichaelTheShifter>	and I was minding my own business
Aug 16 15:23:21 <MichaelTheShifter>	doing coding streams for my community
Aug 16 15:23:25 <MichaelTheShifter>	doing what I did best
Aug 16 15:23:46 <MichaelTheShifter>	and out of the blue, Skype says I get a new message from CherryBlue and bam, I see blimpy's video
Aug 16 15:24:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	and it turns out, even if I broke the ties to the community, well, it hasn't broken it's ties from me
Aug 16 15:24:32 <MichaelTheShifter>	it's still a parasite, feeding off me
Aug 16 15:25:20 <MichaelTheShifter>	in a way, I brought myself into THIS shitstorm, but it wouldn't of even occurred if blimpy hadn't made the video
Aug 16 15:25:52 <nerd73>	it wouldn't have occured of villus hadn't sent you the video
Aug 16 15:25:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'd still be coding ShiftOS, CherryBlue wouldn't be cringing over what he just saw, and we wouldn't be talking
Aug 16 15:26:21 <MichaelTheShifter>	nerd73, he wouldn't of sent me it if it didn't exist
Aug 16 15:26:39 <MichaelTheShifter>	and like... you wanna know the reason he sent me it?
Aug 16 15:26:43 <MichaelTheShifter>	Let me pull up some logs.
Aug 16 15:29:00 <nerd73>	k
Aug 16 15:30:15 <MichaelTheShifter>	fuck, I can't find it, but 2 days ago I remember him saying something about how he may have the possibility of losing his vision as well
Aug 16 15:30:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	so I'm guessing when he saw that video and blimpy mentioned my eyes and said they didn't matter, and that I was still a weird fuck who 'hallucinates', must've raised an alarm.
Aug 16 15:31:11 <MichaelTheShifter>	that and I've told him more than you'll ever know about me.
Aug 16 15:31:49 <MichaelTheShifter>	he even thinks blimpy took it too far.
Aug 16 15:32:09 <MichaelTheShifter>	and this is CherryBlue! The guy who did a similar thing to louisoft's "office suite"
Aug 16 15:32:21 <MichaelTheShifter>	and was one of the most satirical people I've met
Aug 16 15:32:28 <MichaelTheShifter>	and heck HE'S dissed my eyes.
Aug 16 15:32:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	so if someone like CherryBlue is saying blimpy went too far, BLIMPY WENT TOO FAR.
Aug 16 15:33:20 <Jelle>	i personally think that as well
Aug 16 15:34:06 <MichaelTheShifter>	and nerd73, you have no right taking sides on this one. You're the ringleader of team-halouminati.
Aug 16 15:34:08 <psychobat>	i never saw the video, so i can't judge
Aug 16 15:34:22 <nerd73>	I'm not the leader of team-halouminati
Aug 16 15:34:26 <nerd73>	dunno where you got that from
Aug 16 15:34:27 <psychobat>	i'm more along the line of watching the show
Aug 16 15:34:31 <psychobat>	lines of*
Aug 16 15:34:36 <MichaelTheShifter>	who literally tormented ShiftOS for a week, replaced most of the wiki with you shittalking me
Aug 16 15:34:46 <MichaelTheShifter>	and made the privacy policy say 'lol kys'.
Aug 16 15:35:17 <nerd73>	I was part of team-halouminati
Aug 16 15:35:28 <MichaelTheShifter>	nerd73, all the same.
Aug 16 15:35:30 <nerd73>	I never said I was the leader of it

Aug 16 15:40:21 <elCaudillo>	please don't be an obattler and lead a vendetta against me for your fantasies
Aug 16 15:40:37 <elCaudillo>	nerd73 being part of that team can confirm i was not
Aug 16 15:40:41 <MichaelTheShifter>	how am I supposed to trust you don't know about it
Aug 16 15:40:46 <nerd73>	you were never part of the team

Aug 16 15:41:11 <elCaudillo>	believe your fantasies
Aug 16 15:41:18 <elCaudillo>	but i didn't know shiftos had a wiki either lmao
Aug 16 15:41:25 <MichaelTheShifter>	oh I'm not believing anything till I have proof.
Aug 16 15:41:43 <elCaudillo>	whenever i troll some wiki i always append "t. maelask" at the end
Aug 16 15:41:53 <elCaudillo>	mostly i go ahead and exploit unprotected front pages
Aug 16 15:42:07 <MichaelTheShifter>	k, I believe you now.
Aug 16 15:42:09 <MichaelTheShifter>	never saw that.
Aug 16 15:42:13 <elCaudillo>	either with the navy seals copypasta or "NIGGERNIGGERNIGGER"
Aug 16 15:43:03 <elCaudillo>	tbh i pity you
Aug 16 15:43:23 <elCaudillo>	but you should live towards another objective
Aug 16 15:43:29 <elCaudillo>	wealth, for example
Aug 16 15:43:44 <MichaelTheShifter>	what the fuck is one supposed to do with money WHEN THEY CAN'T SEE?
Aug 16 15:43:53 <elCaudillo>	well
Aug 16 15:44:00 <MichaelTheShifter>	if I wanted money
Aug 16 15:44:00 <elCaudillo>	blind people have lives too
Aug 16 15:44:05 <MichaelTheShifter>	ShiftOS would have ads all over it
Aug 16 15:44:08 <MichaelTheShifter>	AND it'd be paid.
Aug 16 15:44:21 <psychobat>	one problem
Aug 16 15:44:48 <psychobat>	you need customers to make money off anything paid
Aug 16 15:45:02 <elCaudillo>	^
Aug 16 15:45:22 <elCaudillo>	there are plenty of jobs a blind person can do
Aug 16 15:45:32 <psychobat>	walmart greeter
Aug 16 15:45:43 <MichaelTheShifter>	if I WANTED money, I would ASK for customers.
Aug 16 15:45:47 <MichaelTheShifter>	I do NOT WANT MONEY.
Aug 16 15:45:57 <psychobat>	that's not how the world works
Aug 16 15:45:59 <elCaudillo>	but programming is a little bit awkward because technology for blind people is still in some early stages
Aug 16 15:46:01 <elCaudillo>	and well
Aug 16 15:46:03 <elCaudillo>	you do want money
Aug 16 15:46:08 <elCaudillo>	how else can you survive
Aug 16 15:46:21 <elCaudillo>	if you go innawoods, you still need a functioning vision
Aug 16 15:46:23 <MichaelTheShifter>	psychobat, I am 14 fucking years old, I have a computer, food, a roof over my head and internet
Aug 16 15:46:27 <elCaudillo>	which you are not guaranteed to have
Aug 16 15:46:31 <MichaelTheShifter>	and free health care, and free schooling.
Aug 16 15:46:33 <elCaudillo>	MichaelTheShifter, your parents are not going to be there forever
Aug 16 15:46:36 <MichaelTheShifter>	that's all I fucking need.
Aug 16 15:46:51 <elCaudillo>	you can't trust for anyone to provide all that
Aug 16 15:46:58 <elCaudillo>	you should strive to be self-sufficient
Aug 16 15:47:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, I know. I'm not talking long-term.
Aug 16 15:47:16 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'm talking right now.
Aug 16 15:47:17 <elCaudillo>	well
Aug 16 15:47:20 <elCaudillo>	you should think long term
Aug 16 15:47:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	I will deal with my adult life when I ACTUALLY BECOME AN ADULT.
Aug 16 15:47:50 <elCaudillo>	there is no rite of passage anymore
Aug 16 15:47:55 <Jelle>	4 years is faster than you think
Aug 16 15:47:58 <Jelle>	actually
Aug 16 15:47:58 <elCaudillo>	how will you know you're an adult and not an older teen
Aug 16 15:48:03 <elCaudillo>	<Jelle> 4 years is faster than you think
Aug 16 15:48:11 <MichaelTheShifter>	people always told me don't think about being an adult, live your life while you can
Aug 16 15:48:18 <MichaelTheShifter>	and that's why I'm not USUALLY stressed.
Aug 16 15:48:26 <elCaudillo>	i'm not stressed
Aug 16 15:48:27 <elCaudillo>	but ffs
Aug 16 15:48:33 <elCaudillo>	utilise the chances you have
Aug 16 15:48:49 <elCaudillo>	your life is not over if you're blind
Aug 16 15:48:53 <elCaudillo>	shake that thought off
Aug 16 15:49:04 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, says the one who criticizes me for not being as smart as him
Aug 16 15:49:07 <elCaudillo>	you can still strive for self-sufficiency
Aug 16 15:49:09 <elCaudillo>	MichaelTheShifter, excuse me?
Aug 16 15:49:10 <psychobat>	life flies
Aug 16 15:49:32 <psychobat>	i still have vivid memories of shit i did a decade ago
Aug 16 15:49:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	trust me, you do.
Aug 16 15:49:40 <elCaudillo>	well, i don't
Aug 16 15:49:55 <elCaudillo>	i am older than you, i therefore think i am in a position to give you some advice on how to move on in life
Aug 16 15:50:10 <MichaelTheShifter>	no, you do. You criticize me for using cosmos, for using .NET, for being a dumbass in february
Aug 16 15:50:20 <elCaudillo>	that was pure trolling
Aug 16 15:50:21 <elCaudillo>	not serious
Aug 16 15:50:24 <elCaudillo>	i'm being serious now
Aug 16 15:50:36 <psychobat>	yeah, because strangers on the internet are the best people to take advice from
Aug 16 15:50:44 <elCaudillo>	do you really think i haven't been a cringey asshole in my early teens?
Aug 16 15:50:44 <Jelle>	[23:49] (psychobat) i still have vivid memories of shit i did a decade ago
Aug 16 15:50:46 <psychobat>	you know it because you heard it here
Aug 16 15:50:47 <Jelle>	same
Aug 16 15:50:57 <elCaudillo>	<psychobat> yeah, because strangers on the internet are the best people to take advice from
Aug 16 15:51:01 <MichaelTheShifter>	I don't need advice from you, especially IN THE MIDDLE OF A FUCKING SHITSTORM.
Aug 16 15:51:04 <elCaudillo>	sometimes it does help
Aug 16 15:51:07 <Jelle>	in 2011 i was cringy af

Aug 16 15:53:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	and something that is picking at shit I can't control?
Aug 16 15:53:37 <MichaelTheShifter>	and shit in the past?
Aug 16 15:53:38 <elCaudillo>	you should give zero importance to things that might hurt you

Aug 16 15:54:12 <MichaelTheShifter>	you can blame HIM for me being here.
Aug 16 15:54:30 <\\_tab4>	you could have ignored him and not come here, lad
Aug 16 15:54:37 <\\_tab4>	you have a mind of your own.

Aug 16 15:55:05 <\\_tab4>	it's not like jacob went to your fucking house and forced you to connect to here

Aug 16 15:58:41 <\\_tab4>	at least blimpy was kind enough to call you something else in that video
Aug 16 16:00:31 <MichaelTheShifter>	\\_tab4, I came here to talk to him in PM

Aug 16 16:00:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	and showed mine
Aug 16 16:01:03 <elCaudillo>	without your intervention nobody could possibly have id'ed you
Aug 16 16:01:13 <\\_tab4>	^
Aug 16 16:01:16 <MichaelTheShifter>	and, excuse my bad short-term memory, but I forget exactly how this whole shit started
Aug 16 16:01:19 <MichaelTheShifter>	but it did.
Aug 16 16:01:45 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, yes, they could've.
Aug 16 16:01:51 <MichaelTheShifter>	he may have given me a fake name
Aug 16 16:01:56 <MichaelTheShifter>	but he didn't give ShiftOS one
Aug 16 16:02:06 <MichaelTheShifter>	someone who wants to ID me could just google ShiftOS
Aug 16 16:02:15 <MichaelTheShifter>	find the two people mentioned in the vid
Aug 16 16:02:16 <elCaudillo>	and they'd find OSFT
Aug 16 16:02:30 <MichaelTheShifter>	OSFirstTimer, who created ShiftOS
Aug 16 16:02:32 <Rakotondramanana>	>ShiftOS
Aug 16 16:02:37 <MichaelTheShifter>	me, who is working on it.
Aug 16 16:02:43 <MichaelTheShifter>	and me, with the eye issues.
Aug 16 16:03:00 <\\_tab4>	well i have to say michael is partially right on that one, BUT THEN AGAIN
Aug 16 16:03:02 <MichaelTheShifter>	and me, who's canadian.
Aug 16 16:03:26 <elCaudillo>	i saw the video
Aug 16 16:03:41 <elCaudillo>	i don't recall hearing "dillam" was from canada
Aug 16 16:03:43 <MichaelTheShifter>	and me, who has talked with ShiftOS members about my experiences at a six-flags amusement park on Gitter
Aug 16 16:03:48 <MichaelTheShifter>	and mentioned Jonny.
Aug 16 16:03:57 <\\_tab4>	ok just pls
Aug 16 16:03:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	Bam, Jonny and ShiftOS, they point instantly to me.
Aug 16 16:04:06 <\\_tab4>	too many tangents
Aug 16 16:04:29 <MichaelTheShifter>	yeah, well this is the internet.
Aug 16 16:04:39 <MichaelTheShifter>	with only a little info about a person with a fake name
Aug 16 16:04:46 <elCaudillo>	well
Aug 16 16:04:51 <\\_tab4>	i wonder if palmer luckey ever raged in the comments section of anyone who did a satire vid on him
Aug 16 16:04:52 <MichaelTheShifter>	you can INSTANTLY find their real internet identity
Aug 16 16:04:54 <\\_tab4>	probs not
Aug 16 16:05:00 <elCaudillo>	i had a picture of me, my dad and a family car online until recently
Aug 16 16:05:12 <elCaudillo>	in all these years nobody found out who i am
Aug 16 16:05:36 <elCaudillo>	i only took it down because obattler was keen on using the pictures for shopping or some shit
Aug 16 16:05:41 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, because you didn't get... exposed...
Aug 16 16:05:52 <elCaudillo>	my face did
Aug 16 16:05:55 <elCaudillo>	my whereabouts did
Aug 16 16:05:57 <elCaudillo>	my full name did
Aug 16 16:05:59 <elCaudillo>	trust me
Aug 16 16:06:05 <MichaelTheShifter>	oh.
Aug 16 16:06:11 <elCaudillo>	my full name is quite rare
Aug 16 16:06:18 <elCaudillo>	spanish names consist of a name and two surnames
Aug 16 16:06:24 <MichaelTheShifter>	and, \\_tab4, it may be satire to you, but if you'd just LISTEN to what it's causing ME, the VICTIM
Aug 16 16:06:24 <elCaudillo>	it's pretty easy to single me out
Aug 16 16:06:32 <elCaudillo>	thankfully nobody exploited that
Aug 16 16:06:35 <MichaelTheShifter>	seriously it's like talking to a bunch of streetlamps.
Aug 16 16:07:04 <elCaudillo>	we're talking about STOP MAKING A MOUNTAIN OUT OF A GRAIN OF SAND
Aug 16 16:07:31 <MichaelTheShifter>	I cannot help I have undiagnosed anxiety issues.
Aug 16 16:07:45 <MichaelTheShifter>	this shit literally scares the fuck out of me.
Aug 16 16:07:49 <MichaelTheShifter>	and I'm hard to scare.
Aug 16 16:07:57 <elCaudillo>	something doesn't check out
Aug 16 16:08:01 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'm the most stubborn asswipe programmer you'll meet.
Aug 16 16:08:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'll go on record and say Keemstar is an angel compared to me.
Aug 16 16:09:10 <elCaudillo>	i mean
Aug 16 16:09:29 <elCaudillo>	anxiety and "hard to scare"
Aug 16 16:09:42 <elCaudillo>	those things don't go together at all
Aug 16 16:09:57 <MichaelTheShifter>	as far as I'm aware, the anxiety only kicks in during this kind of shit
Aug 16 16:10:17 <MichaelTheShifter>	or when I'm in a situation where there are seamingly many bad outcomes
Aug 16 16:11:00 <MichaelTheShifter>	I have the constant fear of people in real life being able to trace my internet actions to me
Aug 16 16:11:10 <MichaelTheShifter>	and ultimately destroying my real life.
Aug 16 16:12:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	heck I get anxious even after accidentally knocking down a photo at my aunt's house trying to put her PC away even though she totally understood it was an accident because I couldn't see
Aug 16 16:12:35 <MichaelTheShifter>	I lose sleep over completely logical shit like THAT.
Aug 16 16:13:03 <MichaelTheShifter>	I lose sleep over pissing off someone in the ShiftOS community because I can't fix a certain bug
Aug 16 16:13:10 <MichaelTheShifter>	or because I had to move the site
Aug 16 16:13:20 <\\_tab4>	is that code for "getting triggered"
Aug 16 16:13:27 <MichaelTheShifter>	or because my BizSpark dried up for the month and the server's down
Aug 16 16:13:33 <nerd73>	the new feature in shiftos 0.1.3
Aug 16 16:13:37 <nerd73>	is that it will get triggered
Aug 16 16:13:39 <\\_tab4>	oh my
Aug 16 16:13:40 <nerd73>	if you insult it
Aug 16 16:13:57 <MichaelTheShifter>	no, 0.1.3 won't ever exist.
Aug 16 16:14:11 <nerd73>	fine, 1.3.0 or whatever then
Aug 16 16:14:14 <\\_tab4>	MICHAEL, I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES I'VE TOLD YOU THIS, BUT GO SEE A FUCKING ADULT AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT
Aug 16 16:14:17 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'm retiring the x.x.x version system for a Windows-like update system using appveyor
Aug 16 16:14:21 <\\_tab4>	._.
Aug 16 16:14:22 <MichaelTheShifter>	memphis will have the same thing
Aug 16 16:14:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	but it won't ever force you to update
Aug 16 16:14:35 <nerd73>	you mean windows memphis?
Aug 16 16:14:38 <nerd73>	:^)
Aug 16 16:14:51 <MichaelTheShifter>	it'll just notify you ONCE about an update and if you defer, it'll shut up
Aug 16 16:14:56 <MichaelTheShifter>	unless you tell it to come back
Aug 16 16:15:14 <MichaelTheShifter>	nerd73, no, I mean github.com/MichaelTheShifter/memphis
Aug 16 16:15:43 <MichaelTheShifter>	\\_tab4, I AM IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT.
Aug 16 16:16:05 <MichaelTheShifter>	BUT MY ANXIETY IS PREVENTING ME, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M MENTALLY ILL.
Aug 16 16:16:28 <elCaudillo>	yet you behave like you are
Aug 16 16:16:35 <MichaelTheShifter>	AND CAN WE STOP TALKING IN CAPS? IT'S MAKING MY THUMB WHICH IS HOLDING THE SHIFT KEY TIRED
Aug 16 16:16:44 <elCaudillo>	you stop lol
Aug 16 16:16:48 <elCaudillo>	\\_tab4 has already
Aug 16 16:17:17 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, behaved*
Aug 16 16:17:26 <elCaudillo>	nah
Aug 16 16:17:27 <MichaelTheShifter>	what happened in february was in the fucking past
Aug 16 16:17:34 <elCaudillo>	you're still behaving pretty weird
Aug 16 16:17:34 <nerd73>	what happened in may 2014
Aug 16 16:17:36 <nerd73>	was in the past
Aug 16 16:17:59 <MichaelTheShifter>	what happened just now as I hit the enter key is in the past
Aug 16 16:18:05 <MichaelTheShifter>	this is in the past
Aug 16 16:18:12 <MichaelTheShifter>	it happened a thousand milliseconds ago
Aug 16 16:18:15 <MichaelTheShifter>	hell a lot more now
Aug 16 16:18:39 <MichaelTheShifter>	and technically, I'm not being the mental one here, my computer is
Aug 16 16:18:50 <MichaelTheShifter>	it's the one generating the bits of data that make up these strings of text
Aug 16 16:18:54 <MichaelTheShifter>	I'm just telling it how.
Aug 16 16:19:04 <MichaelTheShifter>	ain't THAT a mindfuck...
Aug 16 16:21:07 <nerd73>	k
Aug 16 16:21:46 <MichaelTheShifter>	I wish I never ever joined ShiftOS to begin with.
Aug 16 16:22:06 <MichaelTheShifter>	doubt I'll even continue it at this pointi
Aug 16 16:22:55 <MichaelTheShifter>	it just fits in the last space of the circlejerk that is the past 2 years of my life
Aug 16 16:23:06 <nerd73>	that's the spirit, get rid of shiftOS, get rid of the problems
Aug 16 16:23:19 <MichaelTheShifter>	the thingis
Aug 16 16:23:25 <MichaelTheShifter>	what do I do with the site I JUST set up?
Aug 16 16:23:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	and the developers that WANT to work on it
Aug 16 16:23:49 <MichaelTheShifter>	but don't know really what to do with it?
Aug 16 16:23:54 <nerd73>	give it to pcshifter or something
Aug 16 16:24:05 <nerd73>	forget about johnny
Aug 16 16:24:14 <nerd73>	forget about blimpy's video
Aug 16 16:24:17 <nerd73>	problems solved
Aug 16 16:24:20 <MichaelTheShifter>	pcshifter? don't know if he even knows C#.
Aug 16 16:24:42 <MichaelTheShifter>	and I don't want to forget about jonny because he's the best friend I've ever had
Aug 16 16:24:56 <MichaelTheShifter>	besides my friend damian who I'll never see in person
Aug 16 16:24:57 <elCaudillo>	...in your mind
Aug 16 16:25:09 <nerd73>	johnny was never your friend
Aug 16 16:25:13 <MichaelTheShifter>	elCaudillo, at least he didn't try exposing me
Aug 16 16:25:25 <MichaelTheShifter>	and he didn't talk down to me because I couldn't play sports or anything
Aug 16 16:25:26 <elCaudillo>	you barely know him from what i know
Aug 16 16:25:56 <MichaelTheShifter>	you know what fuck this
Aug 16 16:25:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	you're right
Aug 16 16:26:02 <MichaelTheShifter>	I don't know him well.
Aug 16 16:26:19 <MichaelTheShifter>	I just can't make friends anymore!
Aug 16 16:26:29 <MichaelTheShifter>	NOBODY I know IRL likes the same shit as me
Aug 16 16:26:48 <MichaelTheShifter>	everybody my age thinks computers are dumb or they're apple fanboys.
Aug 16 16:26:56 <MichaelTheShifter>	and they all play sports
Aug 16 16:27:34 <MichaelTheShifter>	and they're the type of people who don't want to be seen with the disabled kid
Aug 16 16:27:59 <MichaelTheShifter>	except for this ginger I know, we'll call him, hmmmm, david.
Aug 16 16:28:12 <MichaelTheShifter>	we had each other for this 'random acts of kindness' thing in march
Aug 16 16:28:22 <MichaelTheShifter>	it's rare that you'd get the person who got you
Aug 16 16:28:58 <MichaelTheShifter>	and well, I couldn't do much for him except give him a pack of really yummy donuts and hang out around him during break
Aug 16 16:29:15 <MichaelTheShifter>	but we're still pretty good friends
Aug 16 16:29:28 <MichaelTheShifter>	kinda hope he still goes to my school
Aug 16 16:30:00 <MichaelTheShifter>	god I'm being reduced to tears just thinking about him
Aug 16 16:30:17 <MichaelTheShifter>	wish I had more people like him in my life
Aug 16 16:31:11 <MichaelTheShifter>	but even he thinks that I'm going overboard with jonny...
Aug 16 16:31:35 <MichaelTheShifter>	guess that's another reason I don't want anyone IRL seeing that video
Aug 16 16:31:46 <MichaelTheShifter>	he knows shiftos and he knows my youtube channel
Aug 16 16:32:00 <MichaelTheShifter>	and he's friends with Jonny
Aug 16 16:32:04 <MichaelTheShifter>	so yeah...
Aug 16 16:32:37 <MichaelTheShifter>	I wish I wasn't such a cringy fucktard and maybe none of this would've happened.
Aug 16 16:32:59 <MichaelTheShifter>	I wish this wasn't just textchat so you could hear how I sound right now.
Aug 16 16:33:19 <MichaelTheShifter>	Words on a screen cannot describe emotion.
Aug 16 16:33:40 <nerd73>	they can't
Aug 16 16:34:01 <nerd73>	lwn does have a hangouts tho
Aug 16 16:34:30 <MichaelTheShifter>	you wouldn't want to listen to me crying over this in audio anyways.
Aug 16 16:35:04 <MichaelTheShifter>	plus I don't know how to use hangouts
Aug 16 16:35:08 <MichaelTheShifter>	I do have a discord though
Aug 16 16:35:14 <MichaelTheShifter>	for shiftos
Aug 16 16:35:19 <nerd73>	yeah, the link to it does not work though
Aug 16 16:35:23 <MichaelTheShifter>	but I'll let anyone in as long as they don't mess with us
Aug 16 16:35:27 <nerd73>	just sends you to the web client
Aug 16 16:35:41 <MichaelTheShifter>	you need to install discord though...
Aug 16 16:35:47 <nerd73>	I have discord installed
