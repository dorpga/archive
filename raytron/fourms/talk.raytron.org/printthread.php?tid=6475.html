Apple never ceases to amaze me, or the tech community in general.<br />
<br />
Recently, Apple sent out a few Apple TV developer kits to some developers to develop tvOS apps for the thing.<br />
iFixit was one of them, and they decided to tear down the Apple TV sent to them and post it online.<br />
<br />
Apple, being the draconian bitch company that it is, got very angry and took down iFixit's developer account, which resulted in iOS' iFixit app being gone off the App Store... maybe forever.<br />
<br />
You guys at iFixit are fearless... nice job violating the Non-Disclosure Agreement and leaking the sexy insides of that Apple TV...<br />
<br />
Now I seriously wonder: <span style="font-weight: bold;" class="mycode_b">Why The Fuck Do Non-Disclosure Agreements Exist?</span> &lt;- thread coming soon<br />
<br />
Anyway, discuss here.

<br />
To be honest, it was to be expected. Apple had a contract, and iFixit disobeyed it.<br />
<br />
Now, should that clause have been there in the first place? No.<br />
<br />
But they disobeyed their contract.

No denying that, you get what you deserve.<br />
<br />
One workaround I thought about recently was if iFixit hired an anon to leak the Apple TV's insides on /g/... But then since almost EVERYBODY is anonymous and almost EVERYBODY could be at fault... would Apple attempt to take /g/ down? <span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">Maybe yes, considering how seriously they take their Non-Disclosure Agreement...</span>
