<div class="message">So recently, Apple Inc. launched an app on Android called "Move to iOS". The app's name explains all that it does.<br />
<br />
Let's suppose you bought a new iDevice, and you were an Android user. To facilitate the migration of your data from your Android device to your recently purchased iDevice, you would install the Move to iOS app and let it do its thing.<br />
<br />
Now if you really hated Android (and you buy yourself an iDevice), this app might seem to have an actual purpose.<br />
<br />
...but if it's mere "iOS is better" (which is technically incorrect) propaganda from Apple, then no.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div>

<div class="message">If you have bought a new iPhone to replace your old Android device, then it has a purpose. Other than that, it's pretty useless. You can only use it for when you set your iPhone up for the first time, so if you already customized it and the only thing left do do is moving your contacts for example, then Move to iOS is completely useless.<br />
<br />
And don't forget the ratings of the app in the Play Store. There is countless trolling going on there. Just look at <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios" target="_blank" class="mycode_url">it.</a></div>

This app donates all of its profis to his campaign! Trump never did anything people think!?!?!<br />
* This app made me a grow a handlebar mustache, buy vintage clothes, eat kale, and move to Williamsburg to start an artisan jam company<br />
* So this is Apple's first Android app and they make one like this? Bet Android would never be able to publish their own "Move to Android" app on Apple's App Store.<br />
* Tried this app on my awesome LG G 3, and I wanted an iPhone 6 plus with ios9. Instead it made my phone a BlackBerry curve ... Uninstalling this stupid app and suing it for false advertising !<br />
* I downloaded this app to check it out. Right afterwards, my wife divorced me, my dog ran away, and my house burned down. Steve Jobs visited my dreams last night and explained if I switch to an iPhone, everything will go back to normal, and I'll have the added bonus of being a hipster. Screw that. I'd rather be homeless and alone.</div></div>
At least this is a good review.<br />

<span style="font-style: italic;" class="mycode_i">I just bought an iphone 6s and this will relieve me of the hassle of having to manually input contacts and old pictures!!! I found it so funny how all of you guys are hating only by the fact that this is by apple lol... people really need to learn to grow up</span></div>

Windows Phone probably won't even happen as most apps that exist on iOS/Android do not have an official Windows Phone counterpart. Aka Google+.</div>
